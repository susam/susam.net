* 2007-06-26 - Discovered; reported to vendor
* 2007-07-11 - Public disclosure;
               Vendor moved vulnerable script to another domain


Description
-----------

HomestayFinder has a Wikipedia mirror. The `Dictionary.aspx` script
consumes content from Wikipedia and displays it. The following are the
URLs of the same content on Wikipedia and HomestayFinder:

  - Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux
  - HomestayFinder: http://homestayfinder.com/Dictionary.aspx?q=Linux


Vulnerability
-------------

The `Dictionary.aspx` script doesn't sanitize the input to convert the
HTML special characters into HTML entities. An attacker can edit a
Wikipedia page to introduce JavaScript code. When the same page is
viewed through HomestayFinder, the JavaScript code is executed on the
browser of the visitor.


Exploit
-------

The URL http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Susam_pal/Sandbox consists of
the following JavaScript code embedded as text in the source wiki markup:

    <script>alert('XSS Demo')</script>

The URL http://www.homestayfinder.com/Dictionary.aspx?q=User:Susam_pal/Sandbox
consists of the same code as HTML without the special characters encoded
as HTML entities. Hence, the script is executed on the browser of the
visitor.


Impact
------

* An attacker can execute malicious code in a user's browser within the
  trust relationship between the browser and homestayfinder.com.
* An attacker can steal session cookies and hijack sessions of the
  users of homestayfinder.com.
