Google Re-authentication Bypass
===============================

During a session, while performing a crucial operation Orkut requires a
user to authenticate himself with his or her password in order to
prevent walk-by attacks. If a user fails this authentication, he or she
is redirected to login page for re-authentication. However at this stage
the session is not disabled temporarily at the server-side. This can be
exploited by an attacker to bypass re-authentication.

Description
-----------

On successful Orkut login, the following cookies are set:

    Domain: .www.orkut.com
    Cookie: orkut_state

    Domain: .google.com
    Cookie: SID

    Domain: www.google.com
    Cookie: LSID

The security flaw associated with the first cookie has been explained at
http://susam.net/security/advisory-2007-06-22.txt already.

The second and the third cookies are responsible for another flaw which
is described in this advisory. In the login page of Orkut, the login
form appears from google.com in an inline frame and the form inputs are
submitted back to google.com. Hence these cookies are set for the domain
google.com and www.google.com.


Vulnerability
-------------

When an Orkut user fails to authenticate himself during a session (say,
while deleting a community), the user is redirected to a login page
where the user has to enter his or her password to login again. At this
stage, ideally the session should be disabled and should be enabled only
after the user re-authenticates successfully. However it was found that
the session associated with SID and LSID cookies remains alive at the
server-side. Therefore it is not safe to abandon the session at this
stage. An attacker can set these cookies in his or her browser and
access the compromised account by visiting http://www.gmail.com/ or
https://www.google.com/accounts/ManageAccount or other such URLs.


Impact
------

* If an attacker manages to steal the SID and LSID cookies of the user,
  he or she can gain access to the compromised account even after the
  user has been logged out as described in the previous section.
* In case of unsuccessful authentication during a session, when the
  user is logged out, if he or she leaves the browser unattended, a
  trespasser can login to his or her account simply by accessing a valid
  URL for his or her account.


Solution
--------

When a user fails to authenticate during a session, then the session
associated with the user should be disabled at the server-side. The
session should be enabled only after the user authenticates
successfully.


Prevention
----------

* When a user fails to authenticate himself during a session and he or
  she is logged out for re-authentication, he or she must
  re-authenticate himself to log in and then logout properly by clicking
  the "Logout" link. This deletes the session associated with SID and
  LSID cookies at the server-side.
* A user logged into Orkut, Google, GMail, etc. should not run any
  untrusted JavaScript or program to prevent the cookies from being
  stolen.
