Orkut Server Side Session Management Error
==========================================

The session associated with a user does not expire at the server-side
when a user logs out. It is not disabled when a user fails authentication
during a session. This can be exploited by an attacker to hijack the
session of a legitimate user even after a user has logged out or has
been logged out due to a failed authentication during a session.

After a successful login, Orkut sets a client side session cookie called
`orkut_state` to keep track of sessions. When a user logs out, this
client side cookie is deleted.

When a user fails to authenticate himself during a session (say, while
deleting a community), the user is redirected to a login page where he
or she has to enter his or her password to re-authenticate. The user is
not required to enter the username again. The username is already shown
on the login page and the user is required to enter the password only.
In this case, the client side cookie is not deleted in order to keep
track of the re-authenticating user.

Vulnerability
-------------

Orkut fails to expire or disable the session associated with the
`orkut_state` cookie when the user logs out or fails to authenticate
during a session.


Impact
------

* If an attacker manages to steal this cookie from another user, he
  or she can gain access to the compromised account even after the user
  has logged out because the session associated with it is still alive
  at the server-side.
* In case of unsuccessful authentication during a session, when the
  user is logged out, if the user leaves the browser unattended, a
  trespasser can login to the user's account simply by entering a valid
  URL for his or her account or by clicking the "Home" link.


Previous Advisory
-----------------

Net-Square Solutions Pvt. Ltd. reported a similar issue to Google on
10 February 2006 and released an advisory on 31 January 2007 which
reports the vulnerability to have been fixed with session cookies now
set to expire in 24 hours. This Net-Square advisory is available at:
http://net-square.com/advisory/NS-310107-ORKUT.pdf

However attacks are still possible before the expiry of the cookies as
described in the previous section. A more secure solution is described
in the next section.


Solutions
---------

* The session associated with `orkut_state` cookie must expire at the
  server side when the user logs out.
* The session associated with `orkut_state` cookie must be disabled
  temporarily when a user fails authentication during a session. The
  session should be enabled only after the user successfully
  authenticates himself.


Prevention
----------

* A user logged into Orkut should not run any untrusted JavaScript
  code, program, etc. or click on any suspicious link to prevent the
  cookie from being stolen.
* On a shared system, the user must log out of Orkut by clicking the
  "Logout" link. This would delete the session cookies at the browser
  and another user cannot read the cookie value from the browser.
  Alternatively, the cookie can be removed from the browser.
