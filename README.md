Timeline
--------

On 13 May 2006, I began blogging at [susampal.blogspot.com][BP] via
[Blogger][BL].

On 15 May 2007, I registered the domain [susam.in][WEBSITE] and began
hosting a static website consisting of my open source projects.

On 20 Oct 2011, I began hosting dynamic web pages on [susam.in][WEBSITE]
written in PHP that served my new blog as well as other pages. The blog
posts from my earlier blog at [susampal.blogspot.com][BP] were merged
into this new blog.

On 16 Feb 2019, I turned my blog into a static website generated with a
modified version of [makesite.py][MAKESITE].

On 16 Aug 2021, I turned my blog into a static website generated with
my own Common Lisp program.
