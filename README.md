Timeline
--------

In 2001, I learnt to write simple HTML pages. Soon I began hosting an
intranet web portal using Microsoft Personal Web Server running on a
Windows 98 machine, out of my dorm room at my university.

Between 2001 and 2005, I continued to grow the intranet server. It was
named `maze` and it served my fellow students in our university's
computer network. The server hosted an FTP server and an HTTP portal
for mathematics puzzles, technical articles, free software downloads,
and audio/video streaming. While that intranet portal and its source
code written in Classic ASP are now long gone, some of its content
still survives on my current website.

On 13 May 2006, I began blogging at [susampal.blogspot.com][BP] via
[Blogger][BL].

On 15 May 2007, I registered the domain susam.in and began hosting a
static website consisting of my open source projects.

On 20 Oct 2011, I began hosting dynamic web pages on the website
written in PHP that served my new blog as well as other pages. The
blog posts from my earlier blog at [susampal.blogspot.com][BP] as well
as several pages from Maze (the intranet server I used to run in
university days) were merged into this new website.

On 16 Feb 2019, I turned my website into a static website generated
with a modified version of [makesite.py][PYCODE].

On 16 Aug 2021, I turned my website into a static website generated
with my own [Common Lisp][CLCODE] program. This program is inspired by
and based on [makesite.py][PYCODE].

On 06 Jan 2022, I moved my website to [susam.net][WEBSITE].
