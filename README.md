Timeline
--------

On 13 May 2006, I began blogging at [susampal.blogspot.com][BP] via
[Blogger][BL].

On 15 May 2007, I registered the domain susam.in and began hosting a
static website consisting of my open source projects.

On 20 Oct 2011, I began hosting dynamic web pages on the website
written in PHP that served my new blog as well as other pages. The
blog posts from my earlier blog at [susampal.blogspot.com][BP] were
merged into this new blog.

On 16 Feb 2019, I turned my blog into a static website generated with a
modified version of [makesite.py][PYCODE].

On 16 Aug 2021, I turned my blog into a static website generated with
my own [Common Lisp][CLCODE] program. This program is inspired by and
based on [makesite.py][PYCODE].

On 06 Jan 2022, I moved my blog to [susam.net][WEBSITE].

Maze
----

During my engineering study days back in 2001-2005, I used to run an
intranet server named `maze` for my fellow students in our
university's computer network. The server used to host an FTP server
and an HTTP portal for mathematics puzzles, free software downloads,
and audio/video streaming. While that intranet portal and its source
code written in Classic ASP are now long gone, some of its content
still survives on my current website at [susam.net/maze/][MAZE].
