The <a href="../infosys-tcs-or-wipro/{{ index }}">"Infosys, TCS, or Wipro?"</a>
post is doing the rounds again and some hatred as well as love is
arriving via email. I can understand when someone dislikes the way I
have expressed the whole matter in that blog post. But I fail to
understand the motivation behind some employees of these organizations
trying to justify that working there is almost as good as working for a
company where one can work with a team of very talented engineers. The
earlier post was discussed and debated on <a
href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2628318">Hacker News</a> and
<a href="https://redd.it/lqemo">Reddit</a>. In this post, I'll address
some of the points discussed in these debates.

      <strong>India needs IT services companies:</strong> The most
      popular argument by Indian commenters has been that India needs IT
      services companies because they make a lot of money and boost
      India's economy. This is a straw man. I have never said anything
      to the contrary. In fact, I agree with this point. However, in my
      opinion, students who have learnt their engineering well during
      the engineering course and who now want to improve their
      engineering skills in their professional lives should not work for
      one of these companies. They should join <a
      href="../infosys-tcs-or-wipro/{{ index }}#suggestion">a startup or
      a company known for hiring skilled engineers</a>.

      <strong>Business problems vs. engineering problems:</strong>
      Another popular argument has been that a software company is not a
      place to demonstrate your engineering talent. Many argue that it is a
      place to solve business problems, not engineering problems. I
      disagree with this very firmly. Business problems and engineering
      problems are not mutually exclusive. The reason why many employees
      of these companies feel that solving a business problem wouldn't
      involve solving an engineering problem is that they are not
      skilled enough to even realize whether a particular business problem
      has an engineering solution. I've mentioned in my earlier post
      that engineering problems are there in every software company.
      It needs the mind of an engineer to identify those problems and
      solve them correctly. Not all string parsing problems should be
      solved with a chain of string library functions stitched together.
      Some string processing and parsing work can be done more
      efficiently and reliably by coding a simple DFA. Not all data
      should be maintained as records in an array. Some need to be
      maintained as graphs. A superficial knowledge of regular
      expressions can be dangerous if one does not know what kind of
      patterns they cannot express.

      <strong>Business problems and engineering problems:</strong> If
      you want to solve business problems and keep your customers happy,
      Infosys, TCS, or Wipro might be the right place for you. If you
      want to solve business problems, keep your customers happy, and
      learn a great deal of engineering while doing so, you need to find
      another workplace where you can work with a team of skilled
      engineers who you can give you constructive feedback on your work.

      <strong>Engineering in Adobe, Amazon, Google, etc.:</strong> A
      popular myth that prevails among many is that there is no
      engineering work to do in the Indian offices of Adobe, Amazon,
      Google, etc. I'll reiterate that there is engineering work to do
      in every software company, even in Infosys, TCS, and Wipro. It
      really depends on the people whether they want to take engineering
      seriously or not. Some people would somehow develop the required
      software by stitching together library functions and give up or
      look for inefficient workarounds when a particular task requires
      inventing a new engineering solution. There is another kind of
      people who are ready to invent new engineering solutions with all
      the engineering knowledge they have. They do not hesitate to
      reinvent the wheel when the existing libraries do not meet the
      requirements of the particular problem at hand. Such engineers are
      more in number in startups like Gluster, Parallocity, SlideShare,
      etc. and companies like Adobe, Amazon, Google, Phoenix, RSA, etc.
      These companies also collaborate with universties to learn new
      techniques and concepts to solve business problems. These
      companies do not look for inefficient workarounds when faced with
      a brick wall. They challenge themselves and do everything possible
      to solve a problem in the best possible way. These are the places
      where fresh engineering graduates can hope to learn a great deal
      of engineering from people around them.

  <li id="passion">

      <strong>Passionate people can do engineering anywhere:</strong>
      Another popular argument is that it doesn't matter where you work.
      One can do engineering anywhere, be it Google or Infosys. I agree
      with this. But then, given a place like Adobe, Amazon, or Google
      where the culture and the environment encourages good engineering
      and another place like Infosys, TCS, or Wipro where people are
      generally clueless about good engineering, where do you think you
      are going to learn more and improve yourself faster?

      <strong>But not everyone can join Adobe, Amazon, Google,
      etc.:</strong> Well, I never said that everyone should get into a
      reputed software product company. Not everyone wants to make a
      career in engineering. Some people have other goals in life. They
      just want a regular job. It sounds perfectly fine to me. My post
      was written for those who aspire to make a career in engineering.
      In my opinion, they should try to get into a reputed software
      product company or a startup that is known to hire skilled
      engineers. If they aren't well prepared, the only thing they can
      do is to prepare well to fulfill their aspirations. Some people
      say that they should join Infosys, TCS and Wipro to earn a living
      while they are preparing and I think it's a great advice. I'll
      suggest considering contributing some new features or bug-fixes
      they would like to see in some open source project.
      <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/">Apache Incubator</a> has a
      lot of budding projects. They can also consider authoring their
      own open source projects. They can also try solving problems at
      <a href="http://community.topcoder.com/tc">TopCoder</a>,
      <a href="http://www.codechef.com/">CodeChef</a>,
      <a href="http://www.spoj.pl/">SPOJ</a>,
      <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>, etc. to
      improve their algorithm skills. These are good ways of preparing
      in my opinion.

      <strong>Infosys, TCS and Wipro have good engineers:</strong>
      Many people have told me that there are good engineers in Infosys,
      TCS and Wipro as well. I agree. I never mentioned that 100% of the
      engineers in these companies are clueless about engineering. I
      mentioned that the majority of them are clueless. In fact, drawing
      from my personal experience, I quoted a figure that only 1 out of
      200 are capable of good engineering in these companies. Like most
      guess work, this figure could be wrong but I am pretty confident
      that the bigger picture I am trying to paint here isn't.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li id="training">
    <p>
      <strong>Training:</strong> Many claimed that I am wrong about the
      poor standard of training programs in Infosys, TCS, or Wipro. I
      must tell them that I have attended some of these training
      programs myself. Among the many horror stories pertaining to
      training in these companies, let me share only one with you to
      make my point. In the training assessments, the instructors set
      question papers containing problems with <a
      href="../sequence-points/{{ index }}">code that invokes undefined
      behaviour</a> and ask you to predict its output. "It invokes
      undefined behaviour" is not provided as an option you can select
      as the correct answer. Such training and knowledge is not only
      wrong but also very dangerous. This kind of flawed knowledge leads
      to the development of unreliable, fragile, and insecure software.

  </li>
  <li id="meritocracy">
    <p>
      <strong>Meritocracy:</strong> A few friends of mine expressed that
      I should have mentioned that these companies do not practice
      meritocracy. Anyone with sufficient number of years of experience
      can get a promotion in these companies. It didn't
      occur to me while writing the earlier post but this is true.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li id="leaving">
    <p>
      <strong>Leaving Infosys, TCS, or Wipro:</strong> Some commenters
      commented that people like me just leave these companies and
      discourage others from joining them. They feel that we choose the
      easy way out. They would rather have us stay in these companies
      and improve them. Firstly, getting a job in a reputed company
      with a strong engineering culture is definitely not the easy way
      out. You have to be passionate about your area of interest in
      technology. You have to work hard and prepare yourself for it.
      Secondly, Infosys, TCS, and Wipro were made by their founders with
      a particular vision of providing IT services. They have achieved
      what they wanted with great success. The improvements that you
      want us to make in these companies may not be consistent with the
      vision of the founders. It makes more sense for us to join
      companies where the vision of the founders is consistent with our
      aspiration for doing good engineering work.

      <strong>Solving algorithm problems vs. editing
      configuration:</strong> This has to be the strangest argument I
      have come across. Someone mentioned that a person who solves
      algorithm problems earns no more than someone who only edits
      configuration files. After seeing both sides of the software
      industry, I find this false. Solving an algorithm problem is one
      thing. Solving an algorithm problem efficiently is an entirely
      different thing. I have seen people who can solve difficult
      algorithm problems efficiently in a company with a strong
      engineering culture earning at least three times to five times
      more than those working for Infosys, TCS, or Wipro.
    </p>

</ol>

<p>
To summarize, the <a href="../infosys-tcs-or-wipro/{{ index }}">earlier
post</a> was meant for and only for people who have what it takes to
work at a place where they can solve engineering problems. I have known
many such people who were good engineers but weren't aware of the
reality in companies like Infosys, TCS, or Wipro before joining them.
That post was meant for these people.
