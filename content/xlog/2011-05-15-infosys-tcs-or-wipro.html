<!-- title: Infosys, TCS, or Wipro? -->

<p>
Sometimes computer science, information technology, or electronics and
communications engineering students get placed in two or three major
Indian IT companies and they find it hard to decide which one to join.
<em>"Infosys, TCS, or Wipro?"</em> is one of the most common questions I
have faced from such students. The answer I have for them is much
simpler than they think it is. My answer is,
</p>

<p>
<em>"None."</em>
</p>

<p id="what-this-post-is-not">
Before elaborating my answer further, I should first clarify what this
post is not. This blog post is not about how these companies put food on
the table for hundreds of thousands of engineers. This post is not
about undermining the efforts of these companies. They are probably good
at keeping their customers happy. This post does not intend to offend
the employees of these organizations although that is going to be hard
to avoid due to the nature of this post.
</p>

<p>
This blog post is about a choice that fresh engineering graduates
usually have to make and the information they should have before they
make that choice. This post is about urging these students who want to
make a career in engineering to avoid making a mistake that I did
because I did not have the necessary information at the right time; a
mistake that I corrected two years later after I realized it. This blog
post is about some very unpleasant facts about these major Indian IT
companies that you wouldn't know unless you have been a part of it.

Note: If you are not interested in making a career in engineering, lack
the confidence to do so, or you are very content with working for one of
these three companies for reasons that are valid to you, this post is
not for you. It may not make any sense to you. You might want to stop
reading this post here.

Let me now dispel the different myths that exist about these
organizations one by one. I am not going to mince words while I do this.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Training:</strong> People think that these organizations
      are good for new engineering graduates because they get a lot of
      training which they wouldn't get in other organizations. I must
      remind such people that attending training programs does not
      necessarily amount to learning. Indeed these organizations provide
      a lot of training but only about 1% of the trainees actually
      absorb the knowledge. The 1% that do absorb the training do not
      stick to the organization for a long time because sooner or later
      they realize that they want to do some real engineering work. The
      figure "1%" is not merely a guess. This is my observation across
      various trainee-batches that have been trained in one of these
      organizations. Think about it. Can you learn a new programming
      language in just 3 days? If your answer is "no", you shouldn't
      join one of these organizations. If your answer is "yes", you
      shouldn't join one of these organizations.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Engineering:</strong> One can find engineering problems in
      these organizations but no trace of engineering. For those of you
      who work in one of these organizations and are offended by this
      claim of mine, please revisit your engineering textbooks again.
      Try to remind yourself what you studied then. Consider what you do
      now.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Engineers:</strong> The number of engineers in these
      organizations are very very few; perhaps only 1 in every 200 is an
      engineer. This is a guess, albeit not a wild one. This is why
      there is no engineering in these companies despite the presence of
      engineering problems. "But isn't a degree in engineering the
      minimum qualification to get a job in one of these
      organizations?", you might ask. It is. Yes, all of them have a
      degree in engineering but only about 1 out of 200 is an engineer.
      The rest 199 do not understand why the bitwise operation
      <code>bitcount(not (x xor y))</code> counts the number of bits in
      <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> that match in their
      corresponding positions, why one cannot create a POSIX Basic
      Regular Expression (BRE) to match only strings with arbitrary
      number of balanced parentheses, or how to find the shortest chain
      of connections between two friends in a social network. Note that
      I have used <em>"or"</em> as the conjunction, not "and", in the
      previous sentence. They may be good software users or good
      "software-tailors" who can create software by stitching together
      many library functions but they aren't engineers.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Culture:</strong> These organizations have one of the
      worst kinds of culture you can find in the whole of software
      industry. Very few engineers are busy trying to learn engineering.
      Many employees use the company resources such as corporate blog,
      bulletin boards, etc. to flirt with their female colleagues.
      Others are busy cribbing. Here is a shocking piece of information
      for those who have never worked for one of these organizations:
      One can also manage to find mud-slinging in the corporate forums
      once in a while. Professionalism is at its worst here. But they
      convince themselves that they are professional because they speak
      English fluently and know how to wear a tie. Employees feel their
      salaries are pathetic. I feel they are overpaid. How much should
      such unprofessional people earn?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Onsite:</strong> Contrary to the popular belief, the
      number of trips abroad is not a measure of one's technical
      prowess. Onsite trips are usually driven by project requirements.
      As a result, they often depend on luck. The work done during
      onsite visits can range from technical support to firefighting.
      In fact, some of the smartest engineers I met in these
      organizations were not eager to go for onsite trips due to the
      stressful nature of the work involved. Most of them left these
      organizations, joined a better organization where they could put
      their knowledge and skills to better use and then flew abroad to
      work on good problems where their knowledge and technical skills
      were actually required.

</ol>

Therefore, my answer to the question "Infosys, TCS, or Wipro?" is
"None." That's not a very helpful answer. Here is a more helpful one.
One can consider applying for a job in an organization where he or she
can get an opportunity to solve some engineering problems. One cannot
learn engineering and programming merely by attending trainings. One has
to learn it by doing, solving problems, observing what experienced
engineers do, experimenting, screwing up a few times, reworking, talking
to good engineers, etc. One can try looking for an organization where
the leaders of projects are very good engineers. Startups are more
likely to have them. Some matured ones are <a
href="http://www.gluster.com/">Gluster</a>, <a
href="http://www.parallocity.com/">Parallocity</a>, <a
href="http://www.slideshare.net/">SlideShare</a>, etc. New startups come
up every year. Software companies which develop famous and successful
products are more likely to have them. Some good examples are
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/">Adobe</a>, <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>, <a
href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>, <a
href="http://www.phoenix.com/">Phoenix</a>, <a
href="http://www.rsa.com/">RSA</a>,
etc. How does one figure whether a certain organization is an
organization of engineers?
</p>

<p>
The clue is: <em>Interview</em>.
</p>

<p>
Remember the technical problems they discuss in the interview. Think
about them later. Try discussing them with your friends who are
known for solving tough engineering problems. An interview is not only
an opportunity for an organization to evaluate an applicant, it is also
an opportunity for the applicant to evaluate an organization.
