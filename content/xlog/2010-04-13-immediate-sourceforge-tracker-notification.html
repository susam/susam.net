<p>
  Here are the steps I followed to prevent the tracker email
  notification sent to a SourceForge mailing list address from being
  held for moderation.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Navigate to <em>Mailman admin</em> &gt; <em>Privacy options</em>
    &gt; <em>Sender filters</em>.  Then
    add <code>noreply@sourceforge.net</code> to the list of non-member
    addresses whose postings should be automatically accepted.
  </li>
  <li>
    Navigate to <em>Mailman admin</em> &gt; <em>Privacy options</em>
    &gt; <em>Recepient filters</em>.  Then
    add <code>noreply@sourceforge.net</code> to alias names (regexps)
    which qualify as explicit to or cc destination names for this
    list.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  The first step was necessary because all emails sent by tracker
  has <code>noreply@sourceforge.net</code> as the <em>From</em>
  address.
</p>
<p>
  The second step was necessary because all emails sent by tracker
  has <code>noreply@sourceforge.net</code> as the <em>To</em> address.
