<p>
  An island contained chameleons of three different colours: red,
  green and blue.  The chameleons were studied by some biologists and
  they found that when two chameleons of different colours met they
  changed their colours to the third one.  They found that there were
  2000 red chameleons and 3000 green ones on the day they counted
  them.  They didn't get time to count the number of blue chameleons.

  When the biologists returned to the island two months later they
  found that all chameleons were red in colour.  They were certain
  that no chameleons died because they did not find dead remains of
  any chameleon.  What does it say about the number of blue chameleons
  on the day the biologists counted the number of red and green
  chameleons?
