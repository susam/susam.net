<!-- title: An Hour-Long Ride -->
<!-- tag: miscellaneous -->
<p>
Yesterday, I was returning home from Malleswaram in an auto rickshaw. It
was a long ride because of the terrible Bangalore traffic. At one of the
places where we were stuck for a long time due to traffic, the
auto rickshaw driver began talking to me. To my pleasant surprise,
he talked about poetry, history, geography, mathematics, and
biology. He did most of the talking. I simply listened and responded
when I had something to add. He was fluent in English and Hindi, and he
knew a little bit of Oriya too. He learnt a little more from me. I know
Oriya as I have spent over 20 years in Orissa. Kannada was his mother
tongue.

<p>
For some reason, he believed that the US got its independence on 9 July
1777 even though I told him that it was 4 July 1776. I told him that I
was very sure of the date as it is often used in Hollywood movies even
though I was not sure of the year. He also mentioned that one can't find
water anywhere in the world that tastes better than that of Coimbatore.
He talked about angles and properties of circles when it came to
mathematics. He talked about bones when we talked about biology.

He said that he never went to school but he ensured that his children
got good education. He explained that he learnt most of the things he
was discussing, including Hindi and English, from his children. He said
that he learnt through experience that time is very precious and it
should not be wasted.

<p>
Finally, he explained why he was talking so much. He offered two
reasons:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>To beat the boredom.</li>
  <li>God resides where good ideas are discussed.</li>
</ul>
