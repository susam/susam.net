  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Hi! I am Susam Pal. Welcome to my website. This page provides a
    brief introduction about me and this website.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am a software engineer by profession. I have a keen interest in
    free and open source software. My first non-trivial contribution
    to open source was
    <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NUTCH-559">NUTCH-559</a>
    that added support for various authentication schemes to Apache
    Nutch, an open source web crawler. I have remained active in the
    open source communities since then. I also develop and maintain a
    few open source projects of my own
    at <a href="https://github.com/susam">github.com/susam</a>. For a
    list of my projects, see my <a href="cv.html#opensource">open
    source work details</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    When not involved with technology, I like
    <a href="reading.html">reading books</a>,
    <a href="music/{{ index }}">playing the piano</a>, and travelling.
  </p>

  <h2 id="online">Online</h2>
  <p>
    I am usually online as my IRC nick <em>susam</em> on
    <a href="https://web.libera.chat/">Libera IRC</a>. I hang out at
    various channels like #algorithms, #commonlisp, #emacs, #logo,
    #offbeat, #python, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    The #algorithms channel was founded by me first on Freenode in
    2007 when there was no such channel dedicated to the subject of
    algorithms. It started as a tiny community of about 10 members
    from the ##math channel and then gradually grew to have over 200
    members within a few years. The channel was then migrated to
    Libera in 2021.
  </p>
  <p>
    I hang out on Twitter
    as <a href="https://twitter.com/susam">@susam</a>. I tweet, quite
    infrequently, about technology, programming, and mathematics
    there. Please feel free to follow me there if you are interested
    in these topics.
  </p>

  <h2 id="website">Website</h2>
  <p>
    This website is generated using a Common Lisp program. Most of
    this website is static in nature. The blogs named
    <a href="blog/{{ index }}">Blog</a> and
    <a href="maze/{{ index }}">Maze</a> available on this website are
    also generated statically using this Common Lisp program. The next
    couple of sections have more information about these blogs.
  </p>

    The <a href="https://susam.net/app/comment/?post=about">comment</a>
    and <a href="https://susam.net/app/subscribe/">subscription</a>
    forms on this website are served dynamically using a tiny web
    server program written in Common Lisp.
    See <a href="https://github.com/susam/susam.net">github.com/susam/susam.net</a>
    for the source code of this website.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every line of HTML and CSS that makes this website is handcrafted.
    The primary copy of this website is hosted
    at <a href="https://susam.net/">susam.net</a>. A mirror of the
    website is hosted
    at <a href="https://susam.github.io/">susam.github.io</a>.
  </p>

  <h2 id="blog">Blog</h2>
  <p>
    My primary blog is hosted at <a href="blog/{{ index }}">blog/</a>
    and mirrored at
    <a href="https://susam.github.io/blog/">susam.github.io/blog/</a>.
    I have been maintaining this blog since 2006. The posts on my
    primary blog tend to be long-form, involved, and detailed. They
    sometimes take considerable time to write and publish. As a
    result, I don't update my primary blog very often.
  </p>

  <h2 id="maze">Maze</h2>
  <p>
    I have a digital garden hosted at
    <a href="maze/{{ index }}">maze/</a> and mirrored at
    <a href="https://susam.github.io/maze/">susam.github.io/maze/</a>.
    This is a place where I archive notes, code, and various
    miscellaneous files. The name <em>maze</em> refers to the first
    toy, a ball-in-a-maze puzzle, I had received as a four-year-old
    kid.
  </p>
  <p>
    This digital garden also contains my secondary blog
    at <a href="maze/wall/{{ index }}">maze/wall/</a>. It is a relaxed
    place where I do not worry too much about polishing each post. Due
    to the casual nature of this secondary blog, the posts here are
    less thorough than the ones in my primary blog. This allows me to
    update this blog more often.
  </p>
  <p>
    Maze is a descendant of an intranet server named <code>maze</code>
    that I used to run for my fellow students in our university's
    computer network during my engineering study days back in
    2001-2005. The server used to host an FTP server and an HTTP
    portal for mathematics puzzles, free software downloads, and
    audio/video streaming. While that intranet portal and its source
    code written in Classic ASP are now long gone, some of its content
    still survives on this website.

  <h2 id="colours">Colours</h2>
  <p>
    This website supports both light and dark colour schemes. The
    information box below shows the colour scheme selected right now.
  </p>
  <p class="light highlight">
    This website is currently displayed with <strong>light colour
      scheme</strong>. Note that this is the default color scheme when
      your web browser does not indicate what colour scheme it
      prefers.
  </p>
  <p class="dark highlight">
    This website is currently displayed with <strong>dark colour
      scheme</strong> because your web browser is currently indicating
      that it prefers a dark colour scheme.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you would like to browse this website using the opposite colour
    scheme, please check if your operating system or web browser
    supports changing the preferred colour scheme. Most modern
    operating systems do support it.
  </p>

  <h2 id="name">Name</h2>
  <p>
    I have been told many times that my name, <em>"Susam"</em>, is a
    little unusual which makes it difficult for others to figure how to
    pronounce it. It is pronounced almost like the English words <em>"sue
      sum"</em>. Here's the IPA pronunciation of my name:
    <em>/su&#x2d0;s&#x28c;m/</em>. However you may call my name however
    you find most natural, convenient, or intuitive. I do not mind
    mispronunciations of my name at all whatsoever.
