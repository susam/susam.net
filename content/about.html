  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Hi! I am Susam Pal. Welcome to my website. This page provides a
    brief introduction about me.
  </p>

  <h2 id="work">Work</h2>
  <p>
    I am a security software developer. I currently work as a Senior
    Architect in Walmart Labs. In the past, I have worked in the
    software development teams of Oracle Database Security, RSA
    Security, and Finacle e-Banking Security. For more details, see my
    <a href="cv.html#professional">professional work details</a>.
  </p>

  <h2 id="hobby">Hobby</h2>
  <p>
    I have a keen interest in free and open source software. I have been a
    <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NUTCH-559">contributor
      of security features</a> to
    <a href="http://nutch.apache.org/">Apache Nutch</a>, an open source
    search engine. I also develop and maintain a few open source
    projects of my own at <a href="https://github.com/susam">GitHub</a>.
    For more details, see my <a href="cv.html#opensource">open source
      work details</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    When not involved with technology, I like
    <a href="reading.html">reading books</a>,
    <a href="music/{{ index }}">playing the piano</a>, and travelling.
  </p>

  <h2 id="online">Online</h2>
  <p>
    I am usually online as my IRC nick <em>susam</em> on
    <a href="https://web.libera.chat/">Libera IRC</a>. I hang out at
    various channels like #algorithms, #commonlisp, #emacs, #logo,
    #offbeat, #python, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    The #algorithms channel was founded by me first on Freenode in
    2007 when there was no such channel dedicated to the subject of
    algorithms. It started as a tiny community of about 10 members
    from the ##math channel and then gradually grew to have over 200
    members within a few years. The channel was then migrated to
    Libera in 2021.
  </p>
  <p>
    I hang out on Twitter
    as <a href="https://twitter.com/susam">@susam</a>. I tweet, quite
    infrequently, about technology, programming, and mathematics there.
    Please feel free to follow me there if you are interested in these
    topics.
  </p>
  <p>
    This website hosts my primary blog. I also have a secondary blog
    named <a href="{{ maze }}">Maze</a> where I take notes, share
    puzzles, thoughts, and experiments without worrying too much about
    polishing each post.

  <h2 id="name">Name</h2>
  <p>
    I have been told many times that my name, <em>"Susam"</em>, is a
    little unusual which makes it difficult for others to figure how to
    pronounce it. It is pronounced almost like the English words <em>"sue
      sum"</em>. Here's the IPA pronunciation of my name:
    <em>/su&#x2d0;s&#x28c;m/</em>. However you may call my name however
    you find most natural, convenient, or intuitive. I do not mind
    mispronunciations of my name at all whatsoever.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am also often asked if my name has any meaning. In many Indian
    languages, <em>"su"</em> means <em>good</em> and <em>"sam"</em> means
    <em>even</em>, so my name is supposed to mean good and even.
