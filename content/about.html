<p>
Hi! I am Susam Pal. This page provides a brief introduction about me.
</p>


<h2 id="work"><a href="#work"><a href="#work">Work</a></h2>
<p>
  I am a security software developer. I currently work as a Senior
  Architect in Walmart Labs. In the past, I have worked in the software
  development teams of Oracle Database Security, RSA Security, and
  Finacle e-Banking Security. For more details, see my
  <a href="../cv.html#professional">professional work details</a>.
</p>


<h2 id="hobby"><a href="#hobby">Hobby</a></h2>
<p>
  I have a keen interest in free and open source software. I have been a
  <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NUTCH-559">contributor
  of security features</a> to
  <a href="http://nutch.apache.org/">Apache Nutch</a>, an open source
  search engine. I also develop and maintain a few open source projects of my
  own at <a href="https://github.com/susam">GitHub</a>. For more
  details, see my <a href="../cv.html#opensource">open source work
  details</a>.
</p>
<p>
  When not involved with technology, I like
  <a href="../reading/">reading books</a>,
  <a href="../music/">playing the piano</a>,
  and travelling.
</p>


<h2 id="online"><a href="#online">Online</a></h2>
<p>
  I am usually online as <code>spal</code> (my nick) on
  <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/">Freenode IRC</a>. I hang out
  at various channels like <code>#lisp</code>, <code>#python</code>,
  <code>#debian</code>, <code>##math</code>, <code>##algorithms</code>,
  <code>##security</code>, etc.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>##algorithms</code> channel on Freenode was founded by me in
  2007 when there was no such channel dedicated to the subject of
  algorithms. It started as a tiny community of about 10 members from
  the <code>##math</code> channel and then gradually grew to have over
  200 members within a few years.
</p>
<p>
  I also have a tiny personal channel named <code>#fd100</code> on
  Freenode IRC where some of my friends and I hang out. Please feel free
  to join it and talk to me. To talk to me privately, enter the command
  <code>/query spal</code> on Freenode IRC.
</p>
<p>
  I also hang out on Twitter as <a
  href="https://twitter.com/susam">@susam</a>. I tweet, quite
  infrequently, about technology, programming, and mathematics there.
  Please feel free to follow me there if you are interested in these
  topics. To send a tweet to me on Twitter, <a

<h2 id="name"><a href="#name">Name</a></h2>
<p>
  I have been told many times that my name, <em>"Susam"</em>, is a
  little unusual which makes it difficult for others to figure how to
  pronounce it. It is pronounced almost like the English words <em>"sue
  sum"</em>. Here's the IPA pronunciation of my name:
  <em>/su&#x2d0;s&#x28c;m/</em>. However you may call my name however
  you find most natural, convenient, or intuitive. I do not mind
  mispronunciations of my name at all whatsoever.
</p>
<p>
  I am also often asked if my name has any meaning. In many Indian
  languages, <em>"su"</em> means <em>good</em> and <em>"sam"</em> means
  <em>even</em>, so my name is supposed to mean good and even.
