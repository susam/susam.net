<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi! I am Susam Pal. Welcome to my website. This page provides a
  brief introduction about me and this website.
</p>
<p>
  I am a software engineer by profession. I have a keen interest in
  free and open source software. My first non-trivial contribution
  to open source was
  <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NUTCH-559">NUTCH-559</a>
  that added support for various authentication schemes to Apache
  Nutch, an open source web crawler. I have remained active in the
  open source communities since then. I also develop and maintain a
  few open source projects of my own
  at <a href="https://github.com/susam">github.com/susam</a>. For a
  list of my projects, see my <a href="cv.html#opensource">open
  source work details</a>.
</p>
<p>
  When not involved with technology, I like reading books, playing the
  piano, and travelling.
</p>
<h2 id="online">Online</h2>
<p>
  I have online profiles at the following websites:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/susam">@susam</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Fediverse: <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@susam">@susam@fosstodon.org</a>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="irc">IRC</h2>
<p>
  I am usually online as my IRC nick <em>susam</em> on
  <a href="https://web.libera.chat/">Libera IRC</a>. I hang out at
  various channels like #algorithms, #commonlisp, #emacs, #python,
  etc.
</p>
<p>
  The #algorithms channel was founded by me first on Freenode in
  2007 when there was no such channel dedicated to the subject of
  algorithms. It started as a tiny community of about 10 members
  from the ##math channel and then gradually grew to have over 200
  members within a few years. The channel was then migrated to
  Libera in 2021.
</p>
<h2 id="website">Website</h2>
<p>
  This website is generated using a Common Lisp program. Most of this
  website is static in nature.
  The <a href="https://susam.net/form/comment/?post=about">comment
  form</a> on this website is served dynamically using a tiny web
  server program written in Common Lisp.
  See <a href="https://github.com/susam/susam.net">github.com/susam/susam.net</a>
  for the source code of this website.
</p>
<p>
  Every line of HTML and CSS that makes this website is handcrafted.
  The primary copy of this website is hosted
  at <a href="https://susam.net/">susam.net</a>. A mirror of the
  website is hosted
  at <a href="https://susam.github.io/">susam.github.io</a>.
</p>
<p>
  This website began its life as an intranet portal running on an
  intranet server out of my dorm room during my university days back
  in 2001-2005. That intranet server was named <code>maze</code>. I
  used to run that server for my fellow students in our university's
  computer network. The server used to host an FTP server and an HTTP
  portal for mathematical puzzles, technical articles, free software
  downloads, and audio/video streaming. While that intranet portal and
  its source code written in Classic ASP are now long gone, some of
  its content still survives on this website.
</p>
<h2 id="blog">Blog</h2>
<p>
  My primary blog is available at
  <a href="blog/{{ index }}">blog/</a>. I write about technology,
  mathematics, and other miscellaneous topics on this blog. The posts
  on my primary blog often tend to be long-form, involved, and
  detailed. They sometimes take considerable time to write and
  publish. As a result, the interval between two posts on this blog
  can range from several weeks to months.
</p>
<h2 id="maze">Maze</h2>
<p>
  I have a digital garden at <a href="maze/{{ index }}">maze/</a>.
  This is a place where I archive notes, code, and various
  miscellaneous files. This is a relaxed place where I do not worry
  too much about polishing each post. Due to its casual nature, the
  content here is less thorough than the ones in my primary blog. This
  allows me to update this section often. This portion of the website
  is named after an intranet server named <code>maze</code> that I
  used to run in my university days for my fellow students. The
  name <em>maze</em> refers to the first toy, a ball-in-a-maze puzzle,
  I had received as a four-year-old kid.
</p>

<h2 id="name">Name</h2>
<p>
  I have been told many times that my name, <em>"Susam"</em>, is a
  little unusual which makes it difficult for others to figure how to
  pronounce it. It is pronounced almost like the English words <em>"sue
    sum"</em>. Here's the IPA pronunciation of my name:
  <em>/su&#x2d0;s&#x28c;m/</em>. However you may call my name however
  you find most natural, convenient, or intuitive. I do not mind
  mispronunciations of my name at all whatsoever.
