<!-- title: Non-Commercial Licenses Are Non-Free Licenses -->
<!-- tag: Technology -->
<p>
  I have had to explain this a couple of times on various forums, so I
  thought it would be good to write a post about it and explain why
  non-commercial licenses are non-free licenses. Some examples of
  non-commercial licenses
  are
  <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">CC BY-NC</a>,
  <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">CC BY-NC-SA</a>, and
  <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/">CC
  BY-NC-ND</a>. These are all non-free licenses.
</p>
<p>
  The fact that non-commercial licenses happen to be non-free licenses
  appear to be counterintuitive to some. Isn't prohibiting the usage
  of some artefacts for commercial purpose good for free artefacts?
  Maybe it is. May be it is not. That is irrelevant while deciding
  whether a license is considered free or not. What is relevant though
  is whether the license satisfies the principles laid out in some of
  the widely followed principles of freedom in creative work.
  Especially in the context of software, such as for licensing
  artefacts related to software development and usage, we have a few
  widely accepted guidelines that we can refer to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">Free
    Software Definition (FSD)</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.debian.org/social_contract">Debian Free
    Software Guidelines (DFSG)</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://opensource.org/osd">Open Source Definition
    (OSD)</a>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Note that when we say "free" here, we mean free as in speech, not
  free as in beer. Prohibiting commercial usage of some work violates
  these principles of software freedom mentioned in the documents
  referenced above:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Freedom 0 of the Free Software Definition (FSD): The freedom to
      run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Point 6 of the Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG): No
      Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor: The license must not
      restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific
      field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the program
      from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic
      research.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Point 6 of the Open Source Definition (OSD): No Discrimination
      Against Fields of Endeavor: The license must not restrict anyone
      from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor.
      For example, it may not restrict the program from being used in
      a business, or from being used for genetic research.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  By the way, the OSD was originally derived from the DFSG. That is
  why the OSD looks quite similar to the DFSG.

  So what does this all mean and why should you care? The
  non-commercial licenses are good at doing what they are meant to do,
  that is, prevent commercial exploitation of your work. If that is
  what you want, the non-commercial licenses are perfect for you. But
  it is worth noting that restricting non-commercial usage does come
  at the cost of unhindered collaboration. For example, a work
  licensed under CC BY-NC, CC BY-NC-SA, or CC BY-NC-ND cannot be
  remixed, adapted, or relicensed with work licensed under the CC BY
  or CC BY-SA.
</p>
<p>
  If you want unhindered
  collaboration, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC
  BY</a> is one of the most permissive licenses available from
  Creative Commons. There is
  also <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a>
  which gets as close to public domain as
  possible. <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC
  BY-SA</a> is another good option if you want to ensure that one
  cannot remix your work into some proprietary work and redistribute
  it. But note that even CC BY-SA requires that you do not impose any
  additional restrictions to the license terms. That is, even CC BY-SA
  allows commercial usage and is incompatible with any non-commercial
  license.
