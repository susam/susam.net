<!-- title: May the Forth Be With You -->
<!-- tag: Forth Programming Technology -->
<p>
  I wrote a tiny Forth program today to celebrate the Star Wars Day!
  Today, i.e., May 4 is the Star Wars Day. The date (May the fourth)
  is a pun on the popular Star Wars catchphrase, "May the Force be
  with you." Forth, the programming language, is named so as a
  shortened form of the word "Fourth". The name stood for "fourth
  generation". Quoting
  from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160409083846/http://www.colorforth.com/HOPL.html">Forth
  - The Early Years</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
  The file holding the interpreter was labeled FORTH, for 4th (next)
  generation software - but the operating system restricted file names
  to 5 characters.
</blockquote>
<p>
  So the Forth program presented in this post to print a slightly
  altered Star Wars catchphrase using ASCII stars (asterisks) is like
  a double pun! Or is that a triple pun?
</p>
<p>
  Also, if Yoda were a programmer, I think Forth would be his most
  favourite programming language. Yoda would say, "A Forth programmer
  I am. Hrmmm," and he would add two and two with, <code>2 2 +</code>.
  It just makes a lot of sense to celebrate May the 4th with some
  Forth programming.

<p>
  Here is the program I wrote to celebrate the day:
</p>
<pre>
<code>: stars
   0  do  [char] * emit  loop  ;

: lines
   0  do  cr  loop  ;

: print
   dup 40 > if  40 - lines  else
   dup 20 > if  20 - spaces  else
      stars
   then then  ;

: start
   0  do  print  loop  ;

  To run this program on your system and obtain the above output,
  follow these steps:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Install GForth. On macOS, enter the following command if you
      have Homebrew:
    </p>
    <pre><code>brew install gforth</code></pre>
    <p>
      On Debian, Ubuntu, or another Debian-based Linux system, enter
      the following command:
    </p>
    <pre><code>sudo apt-get install gforth</code></pre>
    <p>
      For other systems or environments,
      see <a href="https://gforth.org/">gforth.org</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Save the above program in a file, say, <code>may4.fs</code> and
      run it with this command:
    </p>
    <pre><code>gforth may4.fs</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Enjoy!
    </p>

  If you do not know Forth but found this post fun and want to learn a
  little bit of Forth,
  see <a href="https://www.forth.com/starting-forth/">Starting
  Forth</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The Forth program in this post and the output is also available as a
  Git repository
  here: <a href="https://github.com/susam/may4">github.com/susam/may4</a>.

  By the way, Forth brings back the fun in computing for me that I
  once experienced when I began learning to code with Logo. It is
  simple, distraction-free, and fun! I will conclude this post with a
  famous quote from Alan J. Perlis:
</p>
<blockquote>
I think that it's extraordinarily important that we in computer
science keep fun in computing. When it started out, it was an awful
lot of fun. Of course, the paying customers got shafted every now and
then, and after a while we began to take their complaints seriously.
We began to feel as if we really were responsible for the successful,
error-free perfect use of these machines. I don't think we are. I
think we're responsible for stretching them, setting them off in new
directions, and keeping fun in the house. I hope the field of computer
science never loses its sense of fun.
