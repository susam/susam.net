<samp>&lt;oops&gt; I have a confusion. the calculation that was giving
       me 2 bits earlier is not giving me 2 bits now. :( please help.
&lt;oops&gt; 4 equally probable symbols: so 4 * (1/4) * log(1 / 1/4), right?
&lt;antonfire&gt; yeah math changes sometimes.
&lt;antonfire&gt; probably a math storm
&lt;antonfire&gt; wait a few minutes and try again
&lt;_Ray_&gt; try logging out and back in
&lt;oops&gt; so, so 1 * log(4) = 2
&lt;oops&gt; oh it is giving me 2 bits again
&lt;mariano|syzygy&gt; hmmm, actually he was not his advisor
&lt;oops&gt; thanks, nvm.
&lt;sig^&gt; try switching math off and on again
&lt;thermoplyae&gt; haha
&lt;_Ray_&gt; yeah, it was the router</samp>
