<!-- title: Toy Traceroute With Ping -->
<!-- tag: Networking Protocol Technology -->
<p>
  Here is an example of a toy traceroute using <code>ping</code> on
  Linux:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>for ttl in {1..30}; do ping -4 -c 1 -t $ttl example.com && break; done | grep -i from | nl -s ' ' -w 2</kbd>

  The output above was obtained on a Debian GNU/Linux 11.2 (bullseye)
  system. The above loop sends multiple ICMP echo requests with
  different Time to Live (TTL) values to reach the host
  for <code>example.com</code>. The TTL occurs as an 8-bit field in
  the Internet Protocol (IP) header of each packet. It is the 9th
  octet in an IPv4 header and the 8th octet in an IPv6 header.
</p>
<p>
  When a router on the path to the destination receives a packet, it
  decrements the TTL value in the IP header by one. If the TTL value
  becomes 0 after the decrement operation, the router responds with a
  "time-to-live exceeded" ICMP message. Thus an echo request with TTL
  value set to 1 gets us an ICMP "time-to-live exceeded" message from
  the first router in the path, the next echo request with TTL value 2
  gets us a similar ICMP message from the second router in the path,
  and so on. The traceroute is complete when we receive a successful
  ICMP echo reply.

  For comparison, here is the output of the
  actual <code>traceroute</code> command:

  Each line in the output above corresponds to a hop. Each line shows
  one or more addresses. A maximum of three addresses can be seen in
  the result for each hop. That is because there are multiple paths to
  the destination and the <code>traceroute</code> command sends 3 UDP
  probe packets by default for each hop. In this manner, it ends up
  discovering multiple routes to the destination. It is worth noting
  here that by default <code>traceroute</code> sends UDP packets, not
  ICMP echo requests, with different TTL values as probe packets. But
  the route discovery mechanism remains the same. After sending each
  probe packet, it waits for ICMP "time-to-live exceeded messages"
  from the routers that fall in the path to the destination.
</p>
<p>
  By comparing the two outputs above, we can see that the route found
  by the toy traceroute using <code>ping</code> is one of the several
  routes found by the <code>traceroute</code> command.
</p>
<p>
  For those on macOS, the <code>ping</code> command options need to be
  modified as follows:
</p>
<pre>
<samp><kbd>for ttl in {1..30}; do ping -c 1 -t 1 -m $ttl example.com && break; done | grep -i from | nl -s ' ' -w 2</kbd></samp>
</pre>
<p>
  On macOS, the <code>-t</code> option of the <code>ping</code>
  command specifies a timeout (not IP TTL) that prevents it from
  waiting for too long for a successful echo reply which we don't
  expect to receive. Further, on macOS, the <code>-m</code> option of
  the <code>ping</code> command specifies the IP TTL.
