<!-- title: Cal 9 1752 -->
<!-- tag: Unix Technology -->
<p>
  A very interesting thing I came across recently while learning Unix
  is an apparent gap in the calendar for Sep 1752. Here is how
  the <code>cal</code> output for this month appears on a Unix or
  Linux system:

  In the SunOS 5.9 manual page
  for <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19683-01/817-3936/6mjgdbv29/index.html">cal(1)</a>,
  this gap is explained as follows:
</p>
<!-- SunOS 5.9 was released on 28 May 2002 -->
<blockquote>
  An unusual calendar is printed for September 1752. That is the month
  11 days were skipped to make up for lack of leap year adjustments.
  To see this calendar, type: <code>cal 9 1752</code>

  Similarly, FreeBSD 5.0 has the following note in its manual page
  for <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=cal&sektion=1&manpath=FreeBSD+5.0-RELEASE">cal(1)</a>:

    Assume the switch from Julian to Gregorian Calendar at the date

    specified, <strong>ncal</strong> tries to guess the switch date
    from the local environment or falls back to September 2, 1752.
    This was when Great Britain and her colonies switched to the
    Gregorian Calendar.

<p>
  On investigating this switch from Julian to Gregorian calendar, I
  learnt that the Julian calendar was introduced by Julius Caesar in
  46 BC and it remained in effect across most of the Western world
  from 45 BC to 1582. It assumed an average year to be 365.25 days
  long. However, the actual solar year has been known to be around
  365.2422 days since the 17th century. Although the difference
  appears to be too small, it leads to an error of adding 1 extra day
  every 128 years. To reduce this error, the Gregorian calendar was
  introduced in October 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII. It assumed an
  average year to be 365.2425 days long.
</p>
<p>
  The new calendar was adopted in some European countries where 4 Oct
  1582 was followed by 15 Oct 1582 thereby skipping 10 days in
  between. However, it took as long as September 1752 for the new
  calendar to be adopted by Britain. In Great Britain and the British
  Empire, 2 Sep 1752 was followed by 14 Sep 1752 and that is the gap
  of 11 days we see in the <code>cal 9 1752</code> output.
