<!-- title: Comfort of Bloated Web -->

<p>
  There is a tiny
  <a href="{{ site-url }}form/comment/?p=hello">comment form</a>
  application on this website to accept comments from visitors and
  save them on the file system of the web server for me to review
  later and publish. This form is one of the only two things on this
  website that is dynamic in nature. The other dynamic part is
  the <a href="{{ site-url }}form/subscribe/">subscription form</a>.
  Everything on this website other than these two things are static in
  nature.

  Most of this website is made of handcrafted HTML. The blog posts and
  other content files are handcrafted HTML pages. A Common Lisp
  program adds common headers and footers to these pages and generates
  the HTML pages that are served as static files via Nginx. The
  comment form, however, is a dynamic web application served via
  another Common Lisp program that makes use of the Hunchentoot web
  server to serve the form, accept the input submitted by the user,
  and then process it. This comment form is a very simple application
  that fulfills the modest requirements of this modest website pretty
  well.
</p>
<p>
  However, often I see multiple copies of the same comment being saved
  on my web server. In the initial days of encountering this issue, I
  felt quite confused. I could rule out a bug in my program by
  carefully reviewing and testing it. Further, the web server logs
  clearly showed multiple POST requests being received by it from the
  same client usually with a few seconds of intervals between the
  consecutive requests. The comments seemed to have legitimate
  content. Since the duplicate copies would all have the same comment,
  I would arbitrarily pick one and publish it on my website. But I
  often wondered why on earth would well meaning visitors would
  sometimes submit the same comment multiple times. For good measure?
  Perhaps! But still quite odd!
</p>
<h2 id="so-what-is-the-problem">So What's the Problem?</h2>
<p>
  The mystery of duplicate comment submission remained a puzzle for
  several months. Then one day, one of the visitors to my website
  contacted me via Twitter messages to tell me that my comment form
  was broken and it was not working for him.
</p>
<p>
  The conversation began like this: "Hey! The comment form on your
  website seems to be broken. It says it has accepted my comment but I
  don't think it is doing that."
</p>
<p>
  I responded, "Hi! Thank you for contacting me about this issue. What
  do you mean it does not accept your comment? Do you see an error?"
</p>
<p>
  "There is no error. In fact, after submitting, I get a success
  message that says, 'Comment was submitted successfully. It may be
  published after review.'"
</p>
<p>
  "That sounds about right. So what's the problem?"
</p>
<p>
  In the meantime, I performed some testing at my end to find that the
  comment form appeared to be working fine with no apparent issues.
  Further, I found that there were multiple copies of his comment
  saved neatly on the server for me to review later and publish.
</p>
<p>
  Before I could share my findings, he continued, "Well! That success
  message appears almost instantly. It couldn't be storing my comment
  successfully that fast, could it?"
</p>
<p>
  That is when the mystery unfolded for me! The issue was that the
  comment form accepts the user's comment and returns with a success
  message too soon for the user to believe that it could have possibly
  saved the comment. I have had a couple of other very similar
  conversations since then when a visitor contacted me via email or
  another means to double-check if my comment form was really working
  fine. In all of these cases, they were skeptical about the success
  message because it appeared much sooner than they expected.
</p>
<h2 id="bloated-expectations">Bloated Expectations</h2>
<p>
  To be honest, I found this experience to be quite bizarre. The
  comment form on this website takes anywhere between fifty
  milliseconds to a few hundred milliseconds to accept the user's
  comment, save it successfully, and then display a success message to
  the user. But apparently, a few hundred millseconds is too fast for
  many people to be able to trust that the comment application is
  actually doing its job. I presume that they have become so used to
  waiting for at least a second or more for dynamic pages to load that
  a web application that finishes its job in a few milliseconds
  appears to be fishy.
</p>
<p>
  I had one visitor to my website even say, "I really was expecting a
  spinning wheel on the browser tab or some sort of progress indicator
  to be assured that it is saving my comment. The instant success
  message took me by surprise!" He felt nervous that his comment was
  not saved and resubmitted the comment again.
</p>
<p>
  As a result of these conversations, I have sometimes even wondered
  whether I should add some artificial delay in the comment
  application before responding with a success message to satisfy the
  expectations of people who are so used to the bloated web. Of
  course, I am not going to do that. That would be silly. I am going
  to keep the comment form in its current shape, as uncomfortable as
  its quickness might be to some users. However, I cannot help but
  remark that the users of the web today have become so comfortable
  with the bloated web that a simple web application that is fast and
  responsive makes them nervous!
