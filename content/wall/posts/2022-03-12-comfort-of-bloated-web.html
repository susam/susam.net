<!-- title: Comfort of Bloated Web -->

  There is a tiny
  <a href="{{ site-url }}form/comment/?post=hello">comment form</a>
  application on this website to accept comments from visitors and
  save them on the file system of the web server for me to review
  later and publish. This form is one of the only two things on this
  website that is dynamic in nature. The other dynamic part is
  the <a href="{{ site-url }}form/subscribe/">subscription form</a>.
  Everything on this website other than these two things are static in
  nature.

<p>
  Most of this website is made of handcrafted HTML. The blog posts and
  other content files are handcrafted HTML pages. A Common Lisp
  program adds common headers and footers to these pages and generates
  the HTML pages that are served as static files via Nginx. The
  comment form, however, is a dynamic web application served via
  another Common Lisp program that makes use of the Hunchentoot web
  server to serve the form, accept the input submitted by the user,
  and then process it. This comment form is a very simple application
  that fulfills the modest requirements of this modest website pretty
  well.
</p>
<p>
  However, often I see multiple copies of the same comment being saved
  on my web server. In the initial days of encountering this issue, I
  felt quite confused. I could rule out a bug in my program by
  carefully reviewing and testing it. Further, the web server logs
  clearly showed multiple POST requests being received by it from the
  same client usually with a few seconds of intervals between the
  consecutive requests. The comments seemed to have legitimate
  content. Since the duplicate copies would all have the same comment,
  I would arbitrarily pick one and publish it on my website. But I
  often wondered why on earth well meaning visitors would sometimes
  submit the same comment multiple times. For good measure? Perhaps!
  But still quite odd!
</p>
<h2 id="so-what-is-the-problem">So What's the Problem?</h2>
<p>
  The mystery of duplicate comment submission remained a puzzle for
  several months. Then one day, one of the visitors to my website
  contacted me via Twitter messages to tell me that my comment form
  was broken and it was not working for him.
</p>
<p>
  The conversation began like this: "Hey! The comment form on your
  website seems to be broken. It says it has accepted my comment but I
  don't think it is doing that."
</p>
<p>
  I responded, "Hi! Thank you for contacting me about this issue. What
  do you mean it does not accept your comment? Do you see an error?"
</p>
<p>
  "There is no error. In fact, after submitting, I get a success
  message that says, 'Comment was submitted successfully. It may be
  published after review.'"
</p>
<p>
  "That sounds about right. So what's the problem?"
</p>
<p>
  In the meantime, I performed some testing at my end to find that the
  comment form appeared to be working fine with no apparent issues.
  Further, I found that there were multiple copies of his comment
  saved neatly on the server for me to review later and publish.
</p>
<p>
  Before I could share my findings, he continued, "Well! That success
  message appears almost instantly. It couldn't be storing my comment
  successfully that fast, could it?"
</p>
<p>
  That is when the mystery unfolded for me! The issue was that the
  comment form accepts the user's comment and returns a success
  message too soon for the user to believe that it could have possibly
  saved the comment. I have had a couple of other very similar
  conversations since then when a visitor contacted me via email or
  another means to double-check if my comment form was really working
  fine. In all of these cases, they were skeptical about the success
  message because it appeared much sooner than they expected.
</p>
<h2 id="bloated-expectations">Bloated Expectations</h2>
<p>
  Depending on where the visitor is located, the comment form on this
  website may take anywhere between 30 ms to 900 ms, and very rarely a
  little longer, to accept the user's comment, save it successfully,
  and then display a success message to the user. But apparently, a
  few hundred millseconds is too fast for many people to be able to
  trust that the comment application is actually doing its job. I
  presume that they have become so used to waiting for at least a
  second or more for dynamic pages to load that a web application that
  finishes its job in a few milliseconds appears to be fishy.
</p>
<p>
  I must clarify here that the duplicate comment submissions do not
  bother me at all. The duplicate comments I receive is a very small
  fraction of the total number of comments. I just find it interesting
  that users can mistrust a simple piece of software that does a
  simple thing in a reasonable amount of time. I had one visitor to my
  website even say, "I really was expecting a spinning wheel on the
  browser tab or some sort of progress indicator to be assured that it
  is saving my comment. The instant success message took me by
  surprise!" He felt nervous that his comment was not saved and
  resubmitted the comment again.
</p>
<p>
  As a result of these conversations, I have sometimes even wondered
  whether I should add some artificial delay in the comment
  application before responding with a success message to satisfy the
  expectations of people who are so used to the bloated web. Of
  course, I am not actually going to do that. I want to keep it
  simple. I do not like adding artificial restrictions to a simple
  piece of functionality. Further, I do not mind the duplicate comment
  submissions at all. However, I cannot help but remark that the users
  of the web today have become so comfortable with the bloated web
  that a simple web application without bells and whistles that is
  fast and responsive makes them nervous!

<h2 id="update">Update</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Update on 13 Mar 2022:</strong> Many commenters to this post
  have suggested that the issue here might not be the fast response of
  a successful comment application but instead the fact that the
  comment form elements remain intact even after the comment
  submission. In their opinion, merely displaying a success message
  may not be assuring enough. They further suggested that I should
  change the state of the form in some way on successful submission.
  Popular recommendations included disabling, clearing, or removing
  the form elements entirely on successful submission.
</p>
<p>
  These suggestions are valid of course. However, I also think that
  these suggestions reinforce the point of my blog post. Users of the
  web today are so used to these fancy features and restrictions that
  without them one feels unsure if the comment form application has
  really done what it is <em>literally</em> saying it has done.
</p>
<p>
  Do I really need to consider <em>artificially</em> clearing,
  disabling, or removing the form elements and thus removing the
  ability to edit a comment again and resubmit it (even if the user
  really so desires) with a single click of a button? What if someone
  wants to post another comment immediately after the first one? What
  if someone wants to edit their previous comment slightly and repost
  it? Do I need to force the user to hop through separate links and
  buttons to be able to do these simple things? "But every other
  website clears, disables, or removes the form elements," you might
  rightfully offer as a counterpoint. I know. I know. But why is it so
  that the "right" user experience nowadays involves artifically
  encumbering the user or hiding the user's own submitted text from
  themselves?
</p>
<p>
  In fact, in an earlier version of this website, the comment form
  application did disable the form elements on a successful comment
  submission. In an even older version of this website, a new page
  consisting only a success message appeared. However, visitors would
  still report their suspicion regarding the comment form doing its
  job to me. So I have observed the results of employing at least two
  of the measures suggested and they were still consistent with the
  reporters' claims that they find the instant success message from
  the application to be disconcerting.
</p>
<p>
  UX best practices notwithstanding, I do not want to hide the users'
  content from themselves after a successful form submission. Maybe
  they want to copy the message and keep it for themselves. Maybe they
  want to edit it again and repost it. I do not want to restrict any
  of these simple things. I also do not want the user to hop through
  another additional link or button to be able to do these things.
  Therefore, heeding some of the other advice I have received, I have
  now made two tiny changes to the comment form application that is
  consistent with its original spirit of simplicity and minimalism: I
  have moved the success and error messages to the top of the page. I
  have also added an additional lines in the success message that
  says, "Your input has been left intact below in case you want to
  copy it, or edit it and resubmit it."
