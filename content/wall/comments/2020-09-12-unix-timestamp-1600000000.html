  The datetime package is one of the best things about Python, and
  dare I say one of the best general purpose calendar modules ever
  written. It's just so <em>practical</em>.

  leap seconds

<p>
  Over long periods of time the approximation that a day takes 86400
  SI seconds becomes less and less accurate as the rotational period
  of the Earth changes. I wish calendars would be either purely
  astronomical in nature or purely SI in nature. Hybrid systems like
  UTC become more and more messy over time as the amount of adjustment
  needed increases. We've had ~25 leap seconds in UTC already, and
  it's a relatively young calendar system.
</p>
<p>
  I also wish we would change the name of the SI measurement "second".
  An SI second and an astronomical second are two different things,
  and deserve two different names.
