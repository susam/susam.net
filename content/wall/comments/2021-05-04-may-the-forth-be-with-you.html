  Also, if Yoda were a programmer, I think Forth would be his most
  favourite programming language. Yoda would say, "A Forth programmer
  I am. Hrmmm," and he would add two and two with, <code>2 2 +</code>.

  Programming in Lisp or Forth is such fun since you can stretch the
  programming language itself. For me, the reflective approach keeps
  the fun in programming.
