  The places near the South Pole are infinitely many. Some of them lie
  on the circle that is \( \left(1 + \frac{1}{2\pi} \right) \) km from
  the pole. Then you'll walk 1 km towards the pole, then circle it (1
  km) and walk back 1 km in the same track away from the pole. Some
  other of them lie on the circle that is \( \left( 1 + \frac{1}{4\pi}
  \right) \) km, you do the same but you circle the pole twice. Thus
  the starting point could be the North Pole or any point that is \(
  \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2n\pi} \right) \) km from the South Pole, for
  any positive integer \( n. \)
