<p>
  For those who were curious why these could both work, note that
  <code>(A &amp;&amp; B) || C</code> differs from <code>A &amp;&amp;
  (B || C)</code> in two cases: when <code>A</code> is
  false, <code>C</code> is true, and <code>B</code> is any value.
</ol>
<p>
  But in this case in particular, those differences would create a bug
  when <code>A</code> is false (the year is not divisible by 4) at the
  same time that <code>C</code> is true (the year <em>is</em>
  divisible by 400). Since that can't happen, the bug cannot occur.
