  Great demo. Even better documentation when you click over to the
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/invaders">project page</a> on
  GitHub.

  Good work. I like that the game is contained within a single
  <code>index.html</code> file.

  Pretty fun for a simple game. Difficulty level ramps
  up <em>very</em> quickly, perhaps overly so for a situation where
  eating quarters isn't a goal.

  built this!

  I love seeing well-organized code in a single HTML file - very easy
  to read and comprehend. Kudos!

  Superfun, nice sound design. Maybe try to scale the number of laser
  pulses with number of ships? The levels are super hard and
  luck-based the first 10 seconds and then drags on a bit.

<p>
  Level 7 on first try, mobile.

  Oh gosh, well done mate! I played it just like back-in-the-day...
  I'm terrible. Level 3.

  So cool, incredibly fun to be such a simple game. Sounds are a big
  part.

  Thanks for making and sharing this! It's awesome to see a dream
  fulfilled!
</p>

  I have a lot of fun making little JavaScript games like this and
  recently made a way to create sprites
  using <a href="https://memalign.github.io/p/pceimage.html">ASCII</a>
  inline with the code. I call these "pixel-character encoded images"
  aka PCEImages. I also made
  an <a href="https://memalign.github.io/m/pceimage/index.html">editor
  web page</a> to help make this ASCII art.
</p>
<p>
  I noticed your sprites are drawn as rectangles in the canvas.
  PCEImage could hopefully drop in pretty easily if you want to try it
  out!

  This is so cool! By the way, I got destroyed in the third level.
