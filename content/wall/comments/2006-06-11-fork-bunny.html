  LOL! Who knew that <code>:</code> was a valid function name?
</p>
<p>
  It is not a valid variable name in Bash though. I think it should be
  a valid fork bomb even without the pipe.

  Yes, the POSIX specification seems to allow implementations to use
  non-alphanumeric characters in function names too. Quoting the
  relevant paragraph from POSIX.1-2001 specification:
</p>
<blockquote>
  The function is named <em>fname</em>; the application shall ensure
  that it is a name (see the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std
  1003.1-2001, Section 3.230, Name). An implementation may allow other
  characters in a function name as an extension. The implementation
  shall maintain separate name spaces for functions and variables.
</blockquote>
