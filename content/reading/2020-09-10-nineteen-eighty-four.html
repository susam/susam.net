They were the homes of the four Ministries between which the entire
apparatus of government was divided. The Ministry of Truth, which
concerned itself with news, entertainment, education, and the fine arts.
The Ministry of Peace, which concerned itself with war. The Ministry of
Love, which maintained law and order. And the Ministry of Plenty, which
was responsible for economic affairs. Their names, in Newspeak:
Minitrue, Minipax, Miniluv, and Miniplenty.

This is a dystopian novel that popularised the term "Orwellian" as an
adjective. The novel centres on the consequences of totalitarianism,
mass surveillance, and repressive regimentation. The novel examines,
quite vividly, how truth and facts are manipulated in a fictional
dystopian society. One might even find some frightening similarities
between the society in the book and the current society in the real
world.
