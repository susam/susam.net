  They were the homes of the four Ministries between which the entire
  apparatus of government was divided.  The Ministry of Truth, which
  concerned itself with news, entertainment, education, and the fine
  arts.  The Ministry of Peace, which concerned itself with war.  The
  Ministry of Love, which maintained law and order.  And the Ministry
  of Plenty, which was responsible for economic affairs.  Their names,
  in Newspeak: Minitrue, Minipax, Miniluv, and Miniplenty.

  This is a dystopian novel that popularised the term "Orwellian" as
  an adjective.  The novel centres on the consequences of
  totalitarianism, mass surveillance, and repressive regimentation.
  The novel examines, quite vividly, how truth and facts are
  manipulated in a fictional dystopian society.  One might even find
  some frightening similarities between the society in the book and
  the current society in the real world.
