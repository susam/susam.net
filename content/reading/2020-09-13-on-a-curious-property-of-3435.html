Take for example the integer \( 3435. \) At first it does not seem that
remarkable, until one stumbles upon the following identity.
\[
  3435 = 3^3 + 4^4 + 3^3 + 5^5
\]
This coincidence is even more remarkable when one discovers that there
is only one other natural number which shares this property with \(
3435, \) namely \( 1 = 1^1. \)

This is a short five-page paper that coined the term <em>Munchausen
number</em> to refer to a number in a given base that equals the sum of
its digits raised to the power of itself. This paper proves that for
every base \( b \in \mathbb{N} \) such that \( b \ge 2 \), there are
only finitely many Muchausen numbers.
