  Take for example the integer \( 3435.  \) At first it does not seem
  that remarkable, until one stumbles upon the following identity.

\[
  3435 = 3^3 + 4^4 + 3^3 + 5^5
\]

  This coincidence is even more remarkable when one discovers that
  there is only one other natural number which shares this property
  with \( 3435, \) namely \( 1 = 1^1.  \)

  This is a short five-page paper that coined the term <em>Munchausen
  number</em> to refer to a number in a given base that equals the sum
  of its digits raised to the power of itself.  This paper proves that
  for every base \( b \in \mathbb{N} \) such that \( b \ge 2, \) there
  are only finitely many Muchausen numbers.
