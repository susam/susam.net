  But for Grothendieck this was not abstraction for abstraction's
  sake.  In his view this was a revolution that was necessitated by
  the questions that mathematics was trying to answer.  He wrote
  volume after volume describing this new language.  Grothendieck's
  vision was messianic, and he began to attract a following of
  faithful young disciples.  His output was huge, covering some ten
  thousand pages.  When a visitor complained at the poor state of the
  library at the Institut, he replied, 'We don't read books here, we
  write them.'

  This book explores the history of prime number theory.  A large
  portion of the book focusses on the history of the Riemann
  hypothesis and its influence in the field of number theory.  The
  book is full of many interesting anecdotes from the lives of great
  mathematicians.
