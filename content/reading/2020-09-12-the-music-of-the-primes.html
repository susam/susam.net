But for Grothendieck this was not abstraction for abstraction's sake. In
his view this was a revolution that was necessitated by the questions
that mathematics was trying to answer. He wrote volume after volume
describing this new language. Grothendieck's vision was messianic, and
he began to attract a following of faithful young disciples. His output
was huge, covering some ten thousand pages. When a visitor complained at
the poor state of the library at the Institut, he replied, 'We don't
read books here, we write them.'

This book explores the history of prime number theory. A large portion
of the book focusses on the history of the Riemann hypothesis and its
influence in the field of number theory. The book is full of many
interesting anecdotes from the lives of great mathematicians.
