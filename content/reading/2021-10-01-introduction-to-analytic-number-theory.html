  Equation (24) becomes

  \[
  np(n) = \sum_{k=1}^n \sigma(k) p(n - k).
  \]

  a remarkable relation connecting a function of multiplicative number
  theory with one of additive number theory.

  This is a fascinating textbook on analytic number theory.  The book
  begins with simple properties of divisbility but it then soon
  introduces several new concepts like the M&ouml;bius function,
  Dirichlet product, the prime number theorem, etc.  The book exposes
  various subtle nuances of the Riemann zeta function \( \zeta(s) \)
  with great rigour and thoroughness.  Results like \( \zeta(-1) =
  1/12 \) that once felt mysterious look crystal clear and obvious
  after working through this book.  I strongly recommend this book to
  anyone who wants to delve into the study of analytic number theory.
