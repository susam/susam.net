  Loved your <a href="../langford-pairing.html">Langford Pairing</a>
  blog post.  Found a small error in the proof of sufficiency.  I
  think the value of \( c \) should be \( 4x - 1 \) and not \( 4x - 3
  \).  Great blog post though!

  Wonderful <a href="../langford-pairing.html">Langford Pairing</a>
  post.  By the way, I believe there is a small typo in the formula
  for \( c \).  It should be \( c = 4x - 1 \).

  Thank you, Ikiatl and Presh, for your comments.  The formula for \(
  c \) indeed had a typo.  Although I wrote the correct values for \(
  c \) obtained from the formula \( c = 4x - 1 \) in the examples, the
  formula itself was written incorrectly as \( c = 4x - 3 \).  I have
  corrected <a href="../langford-pairing.html">Langford Pairing</a> to
  use \( c = 4x - 1 \) now.
