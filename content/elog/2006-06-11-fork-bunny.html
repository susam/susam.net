  Have a close look at this line of shell command that can be executed
  on Bash, Zsh, and most POSIX or POSIX-like shells:
</p>
<pre><code>: () { : | : &amp; } ; :</code></pre>
<p>
  Beware!  Don't execute it on your system without understanding the
  consequences completely.  If the command above looks puzzling, that
  is because it is deliberately obfuscated.  Let us simplify it.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>:</code> is a function name.  It could very well have
  been <code>f</code>.  Let us replace <code>:</code>
  with <code>f</code> and see what the code now looks like.
</p>
<pre><code>f () { f | f &amp; } ; f</code></pre>
<p>
  Now it looks familiar.  We have two commands separated by a
  semicolon.  Written in a more legible manner, the code would look
  like this:
</p>
<pre>
<code>f()
{
    f | f &amp;
}

f</code>
</pre>
<p>
  It creates a function <code>f</code> and then executes it.  This
  function calls itself twice recursively.  The control
  operator <code>&amp;</code> executes the recursive calls
  to <code>f</code> asynchronously, i.e., in the background.  The
  number of instances of the function executing keeps growing
  exponentially thereby depleting CPU cycles and memory.  The system
  is rendered unusable soon.

  This type of denial-of-service attack by self-replication is also
  known as a <em>fork bunny</em> which is a specific type
  of <em>wabbit</em>.  See the following entry in the Jargon File for
  more information on this:
