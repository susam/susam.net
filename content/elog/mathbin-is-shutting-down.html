<!-- title: MathB.in Is Shutting Down -->
<!-- tag: Web, Technology -->
<p>
  About 13 years ago, on a quiet Saturday night, I sat down and began
  developing MathB.in.  Eight hours of coding later, as the sun rose
  on Sunday, 25 March 2012, the website was ready.  I shared it with a
  few friends who loved mathematics.  Back then, we spent hours
  discussing fascinating mathematics problems, and this website became
  a simple way for us to share snippets with each other.  Word spread
  quickly&mdash;my friends shared it with their friends, who passed it
  along to others.  The community grew organically.  Then, one day, I
  announced this project on the MathJax mailing list, and its reach
  expanded even further.  Within a year, this mathematics pastebin
  service had users from around the world.  Watching the usage of this
  little project grow was an incredibly rewarding experience.
</p>
<p>
  The world has changed a lot since then.  The internet has evolved,
  and so have I.  Maintaining a mathematics pastebin service like this
  single-handedly has become increasingly difficult over the years.
  Over the past 13 years, I have received notices from regulatory
  authorities whenever someone uploaded content that triggered
  compliance concerns.  Each time, my web server would be taken
  offline, forcing me to boot them in rescue mode to remove the
  offending content before restoring service.
</p>
<p>
  To prevent these disruptions, I began reviewing and filtering
  incoming content as much as possible every few weeks.  The
  appreciation and positive feedback from happy users kept me going.
  However, at this stage of my life, I can no longer afford to spend
  time moderating user content.  On top of that, the growing
  complexity of data protection and digital safety regulations places
  a significant burden on maintainer of services like this.  I do not
  want to spend my weekends worrying about what users from around the
  world might be posting on this little pastebin service.  Nor do I
  want to be in a constant state of vigilance just to keep my servers
  running and maintain control.  It takes up more time than I can
  afford.
</p>
<p>
  As a result, after much thought, I have regrettably made the
  decision to shut down MathB.in on Sunday, 16 March 2025. The
  website will go offline on that day. If you have any important posts
  that you would like to keep, now is the time to copy and save them
  for yourself.
</p>
<p>
  To all of you who have used this project, I want to express my
  sincere gratitude.  Running a project that could serve you in a
  meaningful way has given me a deep sense of accomplishment and
  pride.  To those who are disappointed by this pastebin service's
  closure, I am truly sorry.  I wish I could continue to dedicate the
  time and effort needed to maintain and develop it, but I must
  acknowledge my limitations and step away from a project that has
  become an artefact of my past, not my present.
