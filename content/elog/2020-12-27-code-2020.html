<!-- title: My Code from 2020 -->
<!-- tag: Programming, Technology, Retrospective -->
<p>
  This is a brief retrospective of my free and open source work this
  year:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/susam/texme">TeXMe</a>: This is an old
    project that creates self-rendering Markdown + LaTeX documents.
    There were two new TeXMe releases last year.  The new releases add
    support for the new and improved MathJax 3 and introduce a new
    pseudo-LaTeX Markdown priority environment.  Version 1.0.0 will be
    coming up next year with more features.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/susam/emacs4cl">Emacs4CL</a>: A 35
    line Emacs initialisation file to quickly set up vanilla Emacs for
    Common Lisp programming.  It provides a good middle ground between
    configuring Emacs manually and installing a ready-made package
    like Portacle.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/susam/spcss">SPCSS</a>: A distillation
    of writing CSS by hand for 20 years.  I have picked the best
    pieces from my boilerplate stylesheets and shared it here.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  That's it for now!  See you next year!
