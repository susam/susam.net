<p>
  On <code>#emacs</code> IRC or Matrix channels, we often share
  references to the built-in Emacs documentation as Elisp expressions
  that look like this:
</p>
<pre><code>(info "(emacs) Basic Undo")</code></pre>
<p>
  Here is another example:
</p>
<pre><code>(info "(emacs) Word Search")</code></pre>
<p>
  If the person on the other end evaluates this Elisp expression in
  their Emacs, then they land on the corresponding section of the
  manual.  For example, if the above Elisp expression is evaluated,
  Emacs shows the section "Word Search" in the built-in documentation
  browser.
</p>
<p>
  Isn't it clumsy to type Elisp expressions like this to share a
  pointer to a section of a manual with others?  Turns out, it is not.
  This is Emacs, so of course there are key-bindings to create these
  Elisp expressions automatically.  For example, say, while helping
  another Emacs user we type <code>M-x info-apropos RET version
  control RET</code> and land on the section "Branches" and realise
  that this is the section that the person we are trying to help
  should read.  Now when we are on this section, we can simply
  type <code>c</code> and Emacs will copy the name of the current Info
  node to the kill ring.  This name looks like this:
</p>
<pre><code>(emacs) Branches</code></pre>
<p>
  Now we can go to the <code>*scratch*</code> buffer (or any buffer)
  and type the following on a fresh new line to create the Elisp
  expression:
</p>
<pre><code>" " C-b C-y C-a C-SPC C-e M-( info C-a C-k C-/</code></pre>
<p>
  This creates the following Elisp expression we need and copies it to
  the kill ring:
</p>
<pre><code>(info "(emacs) Branches")</code></pre>
<p>
  That's how I do it.  The above rather long key sequence first types
  two double-quotes next to each other (<code>" "</code>), then moves
  the cursor back to go within the double-quotes (<code>C-b</code>),
  then pastes the text <code><code>(emacs) Branches</code></code> from
  the kill ring (<code>C-y</code>), then selects the pasted text
  (<code>C-a C-SPC C-e</code>), then surrounds it within parentheses
  (<code>M-(</code>), then inserts the text <code>info</code> just
  after the opening parentheses, and finally we copy the resulting
  expression to the kill ring (<code>C-a C-k C-/</code>).
</p>
<p>
  This may seem like a lot of work but for someone like me who has
  been using Emacs for many years now, all of this muscle memory, so I
  happen to type them without even realising what I am typing.  It is
  sort of like playing the piano.  When you play your favourite song
  on the piano, you don't think of the keys you are pressing.  It is
  all muscle memory.  You just let your brain and fingers do the work
  and your conscious being can simply enjoy the music.  It's like that
  with Emacs too.
</p>
<p>
  Nevertheless, you don't have to form these Elisp expressions in
  exactly this way.  As long as you type <code>c</code> in the Emacs
  info buffer, the name of the current Info node is copied to the kill
  ring.  After that you could copy that node name to anywhere you like
  and the form <code>info</code> expression out of it anyway you like.
  That could mean typing out the rest of the expression manually or
  recording a keyboard macro or writing a little helper Elisp function
  that does this for you everytime you need to do this.
</p>
<p>
  The person who receives this <code>info</code> expression can visit
  the corresponding section of the manual simply by evaluating it.
  For example, after copying the expression in Emacs, they could
  simply type <code>C-y C-e</code> to paste the expression into a
  buffer and evaluate it immediately.  Alternatively, they might want
  to type <code>M-: C-y RET</code> to bring
  the <code>eval-expression</code> minibuffer, paste the expression,
  and evaluate it.
