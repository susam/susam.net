<p>
  In this post, I will discuss some simple tricks I use to square
  numbers that begin or end with the digit \( 5.  \) We will first see
  a few illustrations of each trick.  Then we will generalise the
  tricks for any number that begins or ends with the digit \( 5.  \)

  I learnt this from an arithmetic book during my childhood days.  If
  the first digit of a 2-digit number is \( a \) and the second digit
  is \( 5 \) in decimal representation, then its square can then be
  written as the result of \( a \times (a + 1) \) followed by \( 25 \)
  in decimal representation, i.e., the first few digits of the square
  is given by \( a \times (a + 1) \) and the last two digits are \(
  25.  \) Here are some examples:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>\( 25^2 = 625.  \) (Note that \( 2 \times 3 = 6.  \))</li>
  <li>\( 85^2 = 7225.  \) (Note that \( 8 \times 9 = 72.  \))</li>
</ul>

  After learning the previous trick, I wondered if I could make more
  such tricks for myself.  This is the first one I could come up with.
  If the first digit of a 2-digit number is \( 5 \) and the second
  digit is \( a, \) then its square can be written as the result of \(
  25 + a \) followed by \( a^2.  \) In other words, the first two
  digits of the square are obtained from the result of \( 25 + a \)
  and the last two digits are obtained from the result of \( a^2.  \)
  Here are some examples:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>\( 52^2 = 2704.  \) (Note that \( 25 + 2 = 27 \) and \( 2^2 = 4.  \))</li>
  <li>\( 57^2 = 3249.  \) (Note that \( 25 + 7 = 32 \) and \( 7^2 = 49.  \))</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="squaring-any-number-that-ends-with-5">Squaring Any Number That Ends with 5</h2>

  Let us represent all digits except the last one as \( a, \) e.g., if
  we are given the number \( 115.  \) we say, \( a = 11.  \) Then we
  can express the given number algebraically as \( 10a + 5.  \) Note
  that the square of this number is

  \[
  (10a + 5)^2 = 100a(a + 1) + 25.
  \]

  In decimal representation, this amounts to writing the result of \(
  a(a + 1) \) followed by \( 25.  \) Here are some examples:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>\( 115^2 = 13225.  \) (Note that \( 11 \times 12 = 132.  \))</li>
  <li>\( 9995^2 = 99900025.  \) (Note that \( 999 \times 1000 = 999000.  \))</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="squaring-any-number-that-begins-with-5">Squaring Any Number That Begins With 5</h2>
<p>
  Let us represent all digits except the first one as \( a, \) e.g.,
  if we are given the number \( 512, \) we say, \( a = 12.  \) Then we
  can express the given number algebraically as \( 5 \times 10^n + a
  \) where \( n \) is the number of digits in \( a.  \) Note that

  \[
  (5 \times 10^n + a)^2 = 25 \times 10^{2n} + 10^{n + 1} a + a^2.
  \]

  In decimal reprensetation, this amounts to performing the following
  steps:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Write \( 25 \) as the first two digits.
  </li>
  <li>
    Then write \( a^2 \) as a \( 2n \)-digit number immediately after
    \( 25.  \) Prefix \( a^2 \) with appropriate number of zeros so
    that \( a^2 \) is written with \( 2n \) digits.
  </li>
  <li>
    Write the \( + \)-sign directly below the first digit, that is,
    write the \( + \)-sign directly before the first \( 2.  \)
  </li>
  <li>
    Write every digit of \( a \) including any preceding zeros
    immediately after the \( + \)-sign.
  </li>
  <li>
    Finally add the numbers in both rows column by column performing
    the carrying operation whenever necessary.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Here are some examples:

  \[
  502^2 = \\
  \left\{ \begin{array}{cccccc}
  2 &amp; 5 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 4 \\
  + &amp; 0 &amp; 2 \\
  \hline
  2 &amp; 5 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 4
  \end{array} \right\} = 252004.
  \]

  \[
  512^2 = \\
  \left\{ \begin{array}{cccccc}
  2 &amp; 5 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 \\
  + &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\
  \hline
  2 &amp; 6 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 4
  \end{array} \right\} = 262114.
  \]

  \[
  564^2 = \\
  \left\{ \begin{array}{cccccc}
  2 &amp; 5 &amp; 4 &amp; 0 &amp; 9 &amp; 6 \\
  + &amp; 6 &amp; 4 \\
  \hline
  3 &amp; 1 &amp; 8 &amp; 0 &amp; 9 &amp; 6 \\
  \end{array} \right\} = 318096.
  \]

<h2 id="applying-both-tricks-together">Applying Both Tricks Together</h2>
<p>
  Let us now see an example where we use both the tricks together.
  Let us find \( 5195^2.  \) This is a number that begins with the
  digit \( 5 \) as well as ends with the digit \( 5.  \) We need to
  use the second trick to find \( 5195^2.  \) But the second trick
  begins with writing \( 25 \) immediately followed by the result of
  \( 195^2.  \) so we use the first trick to calculate \( 195^2.  \)
</p>
<p>
  To write the result of \( 195^2, \) we first write \( 380 \) which
  we obtain as the result of \( 19 \times 20 \) and then we write \(
  25 \) immediately after it.  Thus \( 195^2 = 38025.  \) Now we
  perform the second trick as follows:

  \begin{align*}
  5195^2 =
  \left\{ \begin{array}{cccccccc}
  2 &amp; 5 &amp; 0 &amp; 3 &amp; 8 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 5 \\
  + &amp; 1 &amp; 9 &amp; 5 \\
  \hline
  2 &amp; 6 &amp; 9 &amp; 8 &amp; 8 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 5
  \end{array} \right\} = 26988025.
  \end{align*}
