  In mathematics, a function \( f \) from a set \( X \) to a set \( Y \)
  is a relation that associates each element of \( X \) with exactly
  one element of \( Y \).  This page describes the commonly used
  notation, terminology, and concepts pertaining to functions.

<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>
<p>
  A function \( f \) from a set \( X \) to a set \( Y \) is a binary
  relation \( R \) that satisfies the following conditions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    \( R \subseteq \{ (x, y) \mid x \in X, y \in Y \} = X \times Y \).
  </li>
  <li>
    For every \( x \in X \), there exists \( y \in Y \) such that \(
    (x, y) \in R \).
  </li>
  <li>
    If \( (x, y) \in R \) and \( (x, z) \in R \), then \( y = z \).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The set \( X \) is called the domain of \( f \) and the set \( Y \)
  is called the codomain of \( f \).  The relation \( R \) is also
  known as the graph of \( f \).
</p>
<h2 id="notation">Notation</h2>
<p>
  Let \( f \) be a function from a set \( X \) to a set \( Y \).  Then
  the name \( f \) represents the function and the notation \( f(x) \)
  represents the application of the function to the argument \( x \),
  i.e., \( f(x) \) represents the value of \( f \) for the element \(
  x \in X \).  In other words, for all \( x \in X \), we have \( (x,
  f(x)) \in R \).
</p>
<p>
  A function \( f \) with domain \( X \) and codomain \( Y \) is also
  written as \( f : X \to Y \).  The function \( f \) may also be
  written as \( x \mapsto f(x) \).  This notation specifies a function
  that maps \( x \) to \( f(x) \).
</p>
<p>
  Formally, \( f(x) \) denotes the application of the function \( f \)
  to the argument \( x \).  However, in practice, it is common to use
  the expression \( f(x) \) to refer to both the function itself and
  its output for a given \( x \), which is a slight deviation from
  strict notation.  Similarly, the function \( x \mapsto g(x) \) is
  often written as \( f(x) = g(x) \).  For example, the function \( x
  \mapsto x^2 - 1 \) may also be written as \( f(x) = x^2 - 1 \).
</p>
<p>
  Consider a function \( f \) that returns the square of a real
  number.  The following are common notations used to define this
  function, roughly ordered from the most formal form to the least
  formal one:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    \( f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} ; \; x \mapsto x^2 \),
  </li>
  <li>
    \( f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} : x \mapsto x^2 \),
  </li>
  <li>
    \( f : x \mapsto x^2 \),
  </li>
  <li>
    \( f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) where \( f(x) = x^2 \),
  </li>
  <li>
    \( f(x) = x^2 \).
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="domain-codomain-and-image">Domain, Codomain, and Image</h2>
<p>
  The <em>domain</em> of a function is the set of all values for which
  the function is defined.
</p>
<p>
  A <em>codomain</em> of a function \( f \) is a set within which the
  values \( f(x) \) for all \( x \in X \) must lie, where \( X \) is
  the domain of \( f \).
</p>
<p>
  The <em>image</em> of a function \( f \) is the set \( \{ f(x) \mid
  x \in X \} \) where \( X \) is the domain of \( f \).
</p>
<p>
  The term <em>range</em> is often used as a synonym of image.
  However the use of this term is inconsistent across literature.
  Some old books use the term range to mean codomain while other books
  use this term to mean the image.  Therefore it is best to use the
  term image because it is free from such ambiguity.
</p>
<h2 id="injection-surjection-and-bijection">Injection, Surjection, and Bijection</h2>
<p>
  A function \( f : X \to Y \) is <em>injective</em> if \( \forall a,
  b \in X, a \neq b \implies f(a) \neq f(b) \).  A function is
  injective, if each element of the codomain is mapped to by <em>at
  most</em> one element of the domain.  An injective function is also
  known as a <em>one-to-one</em> function or an injection.
</p>
<p>
  A function \( f : X \to Y \) is <em>surjective</em> if \( \forall y
  \in Y, \exists x \in X \) such that \( y = f(x) \).  A function is
  surjective, if each element of the codomain is mapped to by <em>at
  least</em> one element of the domain.  A surjective function is also
  known as an <em>onto</em> function or a surjection.
</p>
<p>
  A function \( f : X \to Y \) is <em>bijective</em> if \( \forall y
  \in Y \), there exists exactly one \( x \in X \), such that \( y =
  f(x) \).  A function is bijective, if each element of the codomain
  is mapped to by <em>exactly</em> one element of the domain.  A
  bijective function is also known as a <em>one-to-one
  correspondence</em> or bijection.  A bijection is both injective and
  surjective.  In other words, a bijection is both <em>one-to-one and
  onto</em>.
</p>
<p>
  The function \( f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}; \; x \mapsto e^x \)
  is injective but not surjective.  It is injective because distinct
  values of \( x \) produce distinct values of \( e^x \).  However, it
  is not surjective as no value in the domain maps to negative numbers
  in the codomain, leaving some elements in the codomain unmapped.
</p>
<p>
  The function \( f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}; \; x \mapsto x^3 - x \)
  is surjective but not injective.  It is surjective because every
  value in the codomain is mapped to by at least one value in the
  domain.  However, it is not injective, as distinct values in the
  domain can map to the same value in the codomain.  For example, \(
  f(-1) = f(0) = f(1) = 0 \).
</p>
<p>
  The function \( f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}; \; x \mapsto x + 1 \)
  is bijective.  It is both injective and surjective.  This function
  is invertible with the inverse given by the function \( x \mapsto x
  - 1 \).
</p>
<p>
  The function \( f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}; \; x \mapsto x^2 \)
  is neither injective nor surjective.  First, the function is not
  injective because distinct values in the domain can map to the same
  value in the codomain.  For example, \( f(-2) = f(2) = 4 \).
  Additionally, the function is not surjective because no value in the
  domain maps to the negative numbers in the codomain.
