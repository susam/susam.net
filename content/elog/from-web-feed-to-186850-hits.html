  Last Sunday (31 Mar 2024), I published a tiny colour guessing game
  called <a href="myrgb.html">Guess My RGB</a>.  I developed most of
  it on Saturday afternoon, took a break, and revisited it later that
  night for some final code cleanup. Around 02:00 UTC, I uploaded the
  game to my website.  Since the entire game is contained in a single
  HTML file named <a href="myrgb.html">myrgb.html</a>, it was just a
  matter of uploading this file to my web server.  Shortly after, I
  went to bed.
</p>
<p>
  I had no intention of sharing this game with a wide audience yet, as
  it hadn't been thoroughly tested. However, when I woke up the next
  morning, I discovered that a Hacker News (HN) user had already found
  and shared the game on HN in this post:
  <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39882018">news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39882018</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Since I had not shared this game with anyone anywhere yet, I was
  quite surprised to wake up Sunday morning and find my game trending
  at the top of HN.  I believe this is where maintaining an RSS feed
  on my website might have helped.  Every new page that I publish on
  this website also appears as an entry in the RSS feed for this
  website.  This feed can be found
  here: <a href="feed.xml">feed.xml</a>.  I have a couple of hundred
  subscribers to this feed.  It is very likely that the HN user who
  shared this game on HN found it through this feed.  Indeed my web
  server logs show that the feed was fetched by a feed reader just
  minutes before the game was posted on HN.
</p>
<p>
  Ever since this game was shared on HN, my website has received a
  large number of hits.  In the last seven days, this game has
  received a total of 186850 hits.  The actual numbers for each day
  look like this:
</p>
<!-- 95467 + 48330 + 22305 + 10189 + 4685 + 2101 + 3773 = 186850 -->

  So the next time someone tells you that RSS is dead, remember how an
  RSS feed entry helped my little game get discovered.  It is a
  testament to the enduring value of simple, open web technologies
  that can amplify your content and connect you with a passionate
  audience.  It took only one entry in my web feed and one kind feed
  subscriber to reach a large audience!
