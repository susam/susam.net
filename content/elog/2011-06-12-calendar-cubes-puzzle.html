  How many different ways are there to assign the ten digits of Arabic
  numerals (0 to 9) to each face of two cubes to ensure that we can
  arrange both cubes on any day such that the front faces of the cubes
  show the current day of the month?
</p>
<p>
  For example, on February 9 the cubes would be placed side by side
  such that the front face of the cube on the left side shows 0 and
  that of the one on the right side shows 9.
</p>
<p>
  Two ways of assigning the digits to the faces of the cubes are
  considered different if and only if it is not possible to get one
  assignment from the other by performing one or more of the following
  operrations:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Rotating (reorienting) the digits with respect to the faces they
    belong to.
  </li>
  <li>
    Rotating the cubes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Swapping the cubes.
  </li>
</ol>

  See the comments page for the solution.
