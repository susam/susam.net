<p>
  Type <code>C-u</code> (i.e., <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>u</kbd>) in Bash
  or Zsh to discard the current line of input.  To read more about it,
  enter <code>man bash</code> and then
  type <code>/unix-line-discard</code> to locate the relevant section
  of the manual.  Here is an excerpt:
</p>
<pre>
<code>unix-line-discard (C-u)
       Kill backward from point to the beginning of the line.
       The killed text is saved on the kill-ring.</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Similarly, for Zsh, type <code>man zshzle</code> and then
  type <code>/kill-whole-line</code>.  We find this:
</p>
<pre>
<code>kill-whole-line (^U) (unbound) (unbound)
       Kill the current line.</code>
</pre>
<p>
  By the way, Emacs-style key sequence like <code>C-a C-k</code> works
  too.
</p>
<p>
  Furthermore, it is quite likely that <code>C-u</code> is mapped to
  delete the current line of input in the terminal itself.  To confirm
  this, type the command <code>stty -a</code> and check the output.
  If the output contains the text <code>kill = ^U</code>, then
  typing <code>C-u</code> anytime in the terminal would delete the
  current line of input.  This would happen regardless of what program
  is running in the terminal.  For example, programs
  like <code>cat</code>, <code>sbcl</code>, etc. do not support key
  sequences like <code>C-a</code>, <code>C-k</code>, <code>C-u</code>,
  etc. the way Bash or Zsh does.  Despite this limitation,
  typing <code>C-u</code> in <code>sbcl</code> would delete the
  current line of input if the output of <code>stty -a</code>
  indicates that the terminal has mapped this key sequence to the
  operation of deleting the current line.
