<!-- title: When HN Folks Made My Terminal Beep 19044 Times -->

<p>
  About three years ago, I set up a tiny <code>netcat</code> loop on
  one of my Debian servers to accept arbitrary connections from the
  Hacker News (HN) community.  The loop ran for 24 hours and did
  exactly two things whenever a client connected:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Send a simple <code>ok</code> message to the client, then close
    the connection.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make my terminal beep four times.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  That's it!  It was a playful experiment in response to a thread
  about quirky, do-it-yourself alerting systems for friends and
  family.  See
  <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30146019#30146451">this
  HN thread</a> for the original discussion.  Here is the exact
  command I ran on my server:
</p>
<pre class="wrap"><code>while true; do (echo ok | nc -q 1 -vlp 8000 2>&1; echo; date -u) | tee -a beeper.log; for i in 1 2 3 4; do printf '\a'; sleep 1; done & done</code></pre>
<p>
  Soon after I shared this, members of the HN community began
  connecting to the demo running on <code>susam.net:8000</code>.
  Anyone in the world could use any client of their choice to connect.
  Here's how I explained it in the HN thread:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Now anytime someone connects to port 8000 of my system
    by <em>any</em> means, I will hear 4 beeps!  The other party can
    use <em>whatever client</em> they have to connect to port 8000 of
    my system, e.g., a web browser, <code>nc HOST
    8000</code>, <code>curl HOST:8000</code>, or even, <code>ssh HOST
    -p 8000</code>, <code>irssi -c HOST -p 8000</code>, etc.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  In the next 24 hours, I received over 4761 connections, each one
  triggering four beeps.  That's a total of 19044 terminal beeps
  echoing throughout the day!

  Now, 4761 isn't a huge number in the grand scheme of things, but it
  was still pretty cool to see people notice an obscure comment buried
  in a regular HN thread, act on it, and make my terminal beep
  thousands of time.  The data for the above graph is archived
  here: <a href="https://gist.github.com/susam/159c7d92659b3185eb0b0d683998a3b7">beeper.log</a>.
  Here are some interesting comments I received on that thread:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    "It's essentially the Hacker News Hug of Deaf." &ndash; @TonyTrapp
  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    "Sending you 4 beeps and seeing that 'ok' was the most web-based
    fun I had in a very long while!" &ndash; @nirse
  </p>

  At the end of the day, this was a fun experiment.  Pointless, but
  fun!  Computing isn't always about solving problems.  Sometimes,
  it's also about exploring quirky ideas.  The joy is in the
  exploration, and having others join in made it even more enjoyable.
  Activities like this are what keep computing fun for me!
