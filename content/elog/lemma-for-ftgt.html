  This post illustrates a key lemma that is used in proving
  the <em>fundamental theorem of Galois theory</em> (FTGT).  Note that
  FTGT is not covered in this post.  The focus here is on
  understanding and proving this lemma only.  Here is the lemma from
  the book <em>Galois Theory</em>, 5th ed. by Stewart (2023):

    <strong>Lemma 12.1.</strong>
    <em>
      Suppose that \( L/K \) is a field extension, \( M \) is an
      intermediate field, and \( \tau \) is a \( K \)-automorphism of \(
      L \).  Then \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1} = \tau(M)^{*} \).

  Note that Stewart writes \( \tau(M)^{*} = \tau M^* \tau^{-1} \) in
  the book but I have flipped the LHS and RHS around so that the
  equation here is consistent with the discussion below.
</p>
<p>
  To develop intuition for this lemma, I'll first present an
  illustration, followed by a proof.  The discussion below assumes
  familiarity with field extensions and field automorphisms, as
  several notations and results from these areas will be used
  implicitly without detailed justification.  This post is meant to
  serve as a set of notes on the lemma, not a comprehensive tutorial.

<p>
  Let \( L = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) \), \( K = \mathbb{Q} \),
  and \( M = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) \).  Note that

  \begin{align*}
    L &= \{ a + b \sqrt{2} + c \sqrt{3} + d \sqrt{6} : a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{Q} \}, \\
    M &= \{ k + l \sqrt{2} : k, l \in \mathbb{Q} \}.
  \end{align*}

  Now

  \[
    \Gamma(L : K) = \{\phi_1, \phi_2, \phi_3, \phi_4 \}
  \]

  where each \( \phi_i \) is a \( K\)-automorphism of \( L \) given by

  \begin{align*}
    \phi_1 &:
    a + b \sqrt{2} + c \sqrt{3} + d \sqrt{6} \mapsto
    a + b \sqrt{2} + c \sqrt{3} + d \sqrt{6}, \\

    \phi_2 &:
    a + b \sqrt{2} + c \sqrt{3} + d \sqrt{6} \mapsto
    a - b \sqrt{2} + c \sqrt{3} - d \sqrt{6}, \\

    \phi_3 &:
    a + b \sqrt{2} + c \sqrt{3} + d \sqrt{6} \mapsto
    a + b \sqrt{2} - c \sqrt{3} - d \sqrt{6}, \\

    \phi_4 &:
    a + b \sqrt{2} + c \sqrt{3} + d \sqrt{6} \mapsto
    a - b \sqrt{2} - c \sqrt{3} + d \sqrt{6}. \\
  \end{align*}

  Then \( M^* = \{ \phi_1, \phi_3 \} \).  Let \( \tau = \phi_2 \).
  Then

  \begin{align*}
  \tau(M)
    &= \{ \tau(x) : x \in \mathbb{M} \} \\
    &= \{ \tau(k + l \sqrt{2}) : k, l \in \mathbb{Q} \} \\
    &= \{ k - l \sqrt{2} : k, l \in \mathbb{Q} \}.
  \end{align*}

  Note that in this case we ended up with \( \tau(M) = M \) but we
  will be careful not to utilise this fact.  We will ensure that the
  steps below work without assuming \( \tau(M) = M \).  Next we find

  \begin{equation}
    \tau(M)^* = \{ \phi_1, \phi_3 \}.
    \label{eq-tau-m-ast}
  \end{equation}

  Now

  \begin{align*}
    \tau M^* \tau^{-1}
    &= \{ \tau \gamma \tau^{-1} : \gamma \in {M^*} \} \\
    &= \{ \tau \phi_1 \tau^{-1}, \tau \phi_3 \tau^{-1} \}.
  \end{align*}

  Let us now find out how each element of \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1} \)
  transforms the elements of \( L \).  For all \( a + b \sqrt{2} + c
  \sqrt{3} + d \sqrt{6} \in L \), we get

  \begin{align*}
    \tau \phi_1 \tau^{-1}(a + b \sqrt{2} + c \sqrt{3} + d \sqrt{6})
    &= \tau \phi_1(a - b\sqrt{2} + c\sqrt{3} - d\sqrt{6}) \\
    &= \tau (a - b\sqrt{2} + c\sqrt{3} - d\sqrt{6}) \\
    &= a + b\sqrt{2} + c\sqrt{3} + d\sqrt{6}).
  \end{align*}

  Therefore

  \[
    \tau \phi_1 \tau^{-1} = \phi_1.
  \]

  Similarly,

  \begin{align*}
    \tau \phi_3 \tau^{-1}(a + b \sqrt{2} + c \sqrt{3} + d \sqrt{6})
    &= \tau \phi_3(a - b\sqrt{2} + c\sqrt{3} - d\sqrt{6}) \\
    &= \tau (a - b\sqrt{2} - c\sqrt{3} + d\sqrt{6}) \\
    &= a + b\sqrt{2} - c\sqrt{3} - d\sqrt{6}.
  \end{align*}

  Therefore

  \[
    \tau \phi_3 \tau^{-1} = \phi_3.
  \]

  We have shown that

  \begin{equation}
    \tau M^* \tau_{-1} = \{ \phi_1, \phi_3 \}.
    \label{eq-tau-coset}
  \end{equation}

  From \eqref{eq-tau-m-ast} and \eqref{eq-tau-coset} we see that

  \[
     \tau M^* \tau^{-1} = \tau(M)^*.
  \]

  Since we are working with a concrete example of \( \tau \) here, we
  know exactly how it behaves, so we succeeded in demonstrating the
  above equality.  However, in a general proof, \( \tau \) is going to
  be an arbitrary \( K \)-automorphism of \( L \), so we cannot know
  exactly how it behaves and as a result, we cannot obtain the above
  equation directly.  Therefore, in a general proof, we are going to
  show that \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1} \subseteq \tau(M)^* \)
  and vice versa to obtain the same result.

<p>
  Once again, let us see how each element of \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1} \)
  transforms the elements of \( \tau(M) \).  Note that this time we
  are not going to examine how they transform arbitrary elements of \(
  L \).  We are only going to see how they transform the elements of
  \( \tau(M) \).  For all \( k - l \sqrt{2} \in \tau(M) \), we get

  \begin{align*}
    \tau \phi_1 \tau^{-1}(k - l \sqrt{2})
    &= \tau \phi_1(k + l \sqrt{2}) \\
    &= \tau(k + l \sqrt{2}) \\
    &= k - l \sqrt{2}.
  \end{align*}

  Similarly, for all \( k - l \sqrt{2} \in \tau(M) \), we get

  \begin{align*}
    \tau \phi_3 \tau^{-1}(k - l \sqrt{2})
    &= \tau \phi_3(k + l \sqrt{2}) \\
    &= \tau(k + l \sqrt{2}) \\
    &= k - l \sqrt{2}.
  \end{align*}

  Note above that both \( \phi_1 \) and \( \phi_3 \) fix \( k + l
  \sqrt{2} \in M \) because \( \phi_1, \phi_2 \in M^* \), the set of
  \( M \)-automorphisms of \( L \).  This detail will be used in the
  general proof.
</p>
<p>
  Since both \( \tau \phi_1 \tau^{-1} \) and
  \( \tau \phi_3 \tau^{-1} \) fix the elements of \( \tau(M) \), they
  are both \( \tau(M) \)-automorphisms of \( L \).  Therefore \( \tau
  M^* \tau^{-1} \subseteq \tau(M)^{*} \).
</p>
<h3 id="lhs-superset-of-rhs">LHS &supe; RHS</h3>
<p>
  Consider the set \( \tau^{-1} \tau(M)^* \tau \) and examine how its
  elements transform the elements of \( M \).  For all \( k + l
  \sqrt{2} \in M \), we get

  \begin{align*}
    \tau^{-1} \phi_1 \tau(k + l \sqrt{2})
    &= \tau^{-1} \phi_1(k - \sqrt{2}) \\
    &= \tau^{-1}(k - \sqrt{2}) \\
    &= k + l \sqrt{2}.
  \end{align*}

  Similarly, for all \( k + l \sqrt{2} \in M \), we get

  \begin{align*}
    \tau^{-1} \phi_3 \tau(k + l \sqrt{2})
    &= \tau^{-1} \phi_3(k - \sqrt{2}) \\
    &= \tau^{-1}(k - \sqrt{2}) \\
    &= k + l \sqrt{2}.
  \end{align*}

  Since both \( \tau^{-1} \phi_1 \tau \) and
  \( \tau^{-1} \phi_3 \tau \) fix the elements of \( M \), they are
  both \( M \)-automorphisms of \( L \).  Therefore \( \tau^{-1}
  \tau(M)^* \tau \subseteq M^* \).  Thus \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1}
  \supseteq \tau(M)^* \).
</p>
<h3 id="lhs-equals-rhs">LHS = RHS</h3>
<p>
  The previous two sections complete the illustration of the lemma
  with the chosen example.  We have shown that \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1}
  \subseteq \tau(M)^{*} \) and \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1} \supseteq
  \tau(M)^* \).  Therefore \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1} = \tau(M)^* \).
</p>
<h2 id="proof">Proof</h2>
<p>
  The ideas presented in the previous sections will now be extended to
  formulate a general proof.  For clarity, the lemma is stated once
  again below before proceeding with the proof.
</p>

  <strong>Lemma 12.1.</strong>
  <em>
    Suppose that \( L/K \) is a field extension, \( M \) is an
    intermediate field, and \( \tau \) is a \( K \)-automorphism of \(
    L \).  Then \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1} = \tau(M)^{*} \).
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Proof.</em>  For all \( \gamma \in M^* \), \( x' \in \tau(M) \),
  we denote \( x = \tau^{-1}(x') \in M \) so that \( \tau(x) = x' \).
  Now

  \[
    (\tau \gamma \tau^{-1})(x') = (\tau \gamma)(x) = \tau(x) = x'.
  \]

  In the third equality above, we have used the fact that \( \gamma
  \in M^* \) which implies that \( \gamma \) is an \( M
  \)-automorphism of \( L \) which allows us to conclude that \(
  \gamma(x) = x \).  Since every \( \tau \gamma \tau^{-1} \in \tau M^*
  \tau^{-1} \) fixes all elements \( x' \in \tau(M) \), each \( \tau
  \gamma \tau^{-1} \) must be a \( \tau(M) \)-automorphism of \( L \).
  Thus \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1} \subseteq \tau(M)^* \).
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, for all \( \gamma' \in \tau(M)^* \), \( x \in M \), we
  denote \( x' = \tau(x) \in \tau(M) \).  Now

  \[
  (\tau^{-1} \gamma' \tau)(x) = (\tau^{-1} \gamma')(x') = \tau^{-1}(x') = x.
  \]

  In the third equality above, we have used the fact that \( \gamma'
  \in \tau(M)^* \) which implies that \( \gamma' \) is an \( \tau(M)
  \)-automorphism of \( L \) which allows us to conclude that \(
  \gamma'(x') = x' \).  Since every \( \tau^{-1} \gamma' \tau \in
  \tau^{-1} \tau(M)^* \tau \) fixes all elements \( x \in M \), each
  \( \tau^{-1} \gamma' \tau \) must be a \( M \)-automorphism of \( L
  \).  Thus \( \tau^{-1} \tau(M)^* \tau \subseteq M^* \).  This
  implies \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1} \supseteq \tau(M)^* \).
</p>
<p>
  We have shown that \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1} \subseteq \tau(M)^* \) and
  \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1} \supseteq \tau(M)^* \).  Therefore \( \tau M^*
  \tau^{-1} = \tau(M)^* \).
