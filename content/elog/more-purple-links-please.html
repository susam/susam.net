<!-- title: More Purple Links, Please -->
<!-- tag: Web, Technology -->
<p>
  When I am browsing the Web, there is one thing I love to see more
  than anything else: purple links!  Since the early days of the Web,
  purple has been the colour typically used to indicate visited links.
  While there were other conventions in use in the early days of the
  Web, purple has emerged as the default colour for visited links at
  least since the mid-90s.  Here's a relevant note from
  the <a href="https://ksi.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/archives/WWW-TALK/www-talk-1993q2.messages/47.html">changelog
  of NCSA Mosaic 0.13</a>:

<blockquote>
  Changed default anchor representations: blue and single solid
  underline for unvisited, dark purple and single dashed underline for
  visited.

  Visiting a web page and finding purple links in the article is a
  comforting experience.  It means I'm familiar with most of the
  references the article makes to other content.  Each purple link
  serves as a small marker of a prior journey, a reminder that I've
  explored certain paths before.  This sense of familiarity adds
  to the comfort and fluidity of browsing the Web.

  I can't help but think of my bookshelf.  The books I've read, the
  ones I've returned to time and again, show their wear.  The pages
  are dog-eared, the covers faded, and the spines creased.  These
  books have lived with me and shaped my thinking.  Compare that to
  the pristine, untouched books, still waiting to be read.  They are
  beautiful, yes, but they have not become a part of my life yet.  The
  same goes for links.  The purple ones are like the worn-out books.
  They are the references I've explored, the paths I've taken.  They
  are familiar and comfortable.  The blue ones are like the shiny new
  books on the shelf.  They represent new paths, yet to be explored.

  Although I'm quite fond of purple links, I know that not everyone
  shares my sentiment.  Modern web design trends have moved away from
  this tradition, favouring sleek, minimalist aesthetics where visited
  and unvisisted links look nearly the same, or even using custom
  colours for visited links.  While this can be visually appealing, it
  subtracts from the experience of using the Web as a source of
  knowledge.  When links look indistinguishable or unconventional, it
  can be hard to tell what I've already read, especially when I am
  revisiting a topic and want to easily spot the links that are new.
</p>
<p>
  In the end, sticking with the default purple for visited links isn't
  just about tradition; it is about simplicity and clarity.  It is a
  small but reliable visual cue that makes navigating the Web easier
  and more intuitive, for me, at least.  For me, those purple links
  are a quiet comfort, a small reminder of all the digital paths I've
  already walked.  I wish more websites would keep them that way.
  More purple links, please.
