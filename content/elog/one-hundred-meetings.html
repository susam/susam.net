  Today, our computation book discussion group is going to have the
  100th meeting!  Yes, <a href="cc/iant/log.html#100">the 100th
  meeting</a>!  We began these book discussion meetings about five
  months ago.  The first book we picked up for our discussions
  was <em>Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</em> (Apostol, 1976).
  We have been reading this book together for the last five months.
  We have a tiny but consistent community of 6 to 8 participants who
  meet regularly to study this book and share our understanding and
  insights with each other.
</p>
<p>
  In this blog post, I will talk about my personal experience hosting
  these meetings and my personal journey about reading this book.  It
  is worth keeping in mind then that what I am about to write below
  may not have any resemblance with the experience of other
  participants of these meetings.

<h2 id="the-reading-experience">The Reading Experience</h2>
<p>
  As far as I know, everyone who joins our meetings are involved in
  computer programming in one form or another.  A few of them have
  very strong background in mathematics.  I host these meetings
  everyday and discuss a few sections of the book in detail.  I show
  how to work through the proofs, explain some of the steps, etc.
  Sometimes I get stuck in some step that I find too unobvious.
  Sometimes the steps are obvious but my brain is too slow to
  understand why the steps work.  But these tiny glitches have not
  been a problem so far, thanks to all the members who join these
  meetings on a daily basis and contribute their explanations of the
  proofs.
</p>
<p>
  I believe the group members are the best part of these discussions.
  Thanks to the insights and explanation of the reading material
  shared by all these members, I am fairly confident that we are able
  to take a close look at every proof and convince ourselves that
  every step of the proofs work.

<h2 id="the-learning-experience">The Learning Experience</h2>
<p>
  The first web meeting to discuss the chosen analytic number theory
  book occurred on 5 Mar 2021.  See the blog
  post <a href="reading-classic-computation-books.html">Reading
  Classic Computation Books</a> to read about the early days of our
  group and how it was formed.  Back then, I knew little to nothing
  about analytic number theory.  Although I was familiar with some of
  the elementary concepts like divisibility, Euler's totient function,
  modular arithmetic, calculus, and related theorems, chapter 2 of the
  book itself proved to be a significant challenge for me.  In the
  second chapter, it became clear to me that we will be building new
  levels of mathematical abstractions, use these abstractions to build
  yet another layer of abstractions, and so on.  The chapter began
  with a description of the M&ouml;bius function, a very neat and
  interesting function that I was previously unaware of.  That was
  fun!  But soon, this chapter began adding new layers of abstractions
  such as Dirichlet product, Dirichlet inverse, generalised
  convolution, etc.  I could almost feel my brain stretching and
  growing as we went through each page of this chapter.
</p>
<p>
  I often saw that after I have learnt a new concept in a chapter, it
  would not become intuitive immediately.  I would understand the
  concepts, understand the related theorems, understand each step of
  the proofs, solve exercise problems, know how to apply the theorems
  when needed, and yet I could not "feel" them.  I wanted to not just
  understand the concepts but I also wanted to "feel" the concepts
  like the way I could feel algebra, calculus, computer programming,
  etc.  In the initial days, I wondered if I was too old to develop
  good intuition for all these new and highly sophisticated concepts.
</p>
<p>
  Despite always feeling that all these concepts were too technical
  and quite unintuitive, I kept going.  I kept hosting these
  discussions with a frequency of about 3-5 days every week.  We
  continued discussing the various chapters and the proofs in them.
  And then suddenly one day while reading chapter 4, something
  interesting happened.  As we were employing Dirichlet products to
  obtain some useful results, I realised that the concept
  of <em>Dirichlet products</em> which once felt so foreign two
  chapters earlier, now felt completely intuitive.  I
  could <em>see</em> different functions being equivalent to Dirichlet
  products intuitively and effortlessly.  Dirichlet products felt no
  more alien than, say, arithmetic multiplication.  I could "feel" it
  now.  It was a great feeling.  I realised that sometimes it might
  take a few additional chapters of reading and using those concepts
  over and over again before they really begin to feel intuitive.
</p>
<h2 id="three-concepts">Three Concepts</h2>
<p>
  In this section, I will pick three interesting concepts from
  different parts of the book to provide a glimpse of what the journey
  has been like.  These three things occur in the book again and again
  and play a very important role in several chapters of the book.  Of
  course, it goes without saying that there are many interesting
  concepts in the book and many of them may be more important than the
  ones I am about to show below.
</p>
<h3 id="the-mobius-function">The M&ouml;bius Function</h3>
<p>
 For any positive integer \( n, \) the M&ouml;bius function \( \mu(n)
 \) is defined as follows:

 \[
   \mu(1) = 1; \] If \( n &gt; 1,
 \)

 write \( n = p_1^{a_1} \dots p_k^{a_k} \) (prime factorisation).
 Then

 \begin{align*}
   \mu(n) &amp; = (-1)^k \text{ if } a_1 = a_2 = \dots = a_k = 1, \\
   \mu(n) &amp; = 0 \text{ otherwise}.
 \end{align*}

 If \( n \ge 1, \) we have

 \[
   \sum_{d \mid n} \mu(d) =
   \begin{cases}
   1 &amp; \text{ if } n = 1, \\
   0 &amp; \text{ if } n &gt; 1.
   \end{cases}
 \]
</p>
<p>
  I was unfamiliar with this function prior to reading the book.  It
  felt like a nice little cute function initially but as we went
  through more chapters, it soon became clear that this function plays
  a major role in analytic number theory.
</p>
<p>
  As a simple example, we will soon see in this post that the Euler's
  totient function can be expressed as a Dirichlet product of the
  M&ouml;bius function and the arithmetical function \( N(n) = n.  \)
</p>
<p>
  As a more sophisticated example, the Dirichlet series with
  coefficients as the M&ouml;bius function is the multiplicative
  inverse of the Riemann zeta function, i.e., if \( s = \sigma + it \)
  is a complex number with its real part \( \sigma &gt; 1, \) we have

  \[
    \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\mu(n)}{n^s} = \frac{1}{\zeta(s)}.
  \]

  This immediately shows that \( \zeta(s) \ne 0 \) for \( \sigma &gt;
  1.  \)
</p>
<h3 id="dirichlet-product">Dirichlet Product</h3>
<p>
  If \( f \) and \( g \) are two arithmetical functions, their
  Dirichlet product \( f * g \) is defined as:

  \[
    (f * g)(n) = \sum_{d \mid n} f(d) g\left( \frac{n}{d} \right).
  \]

  Dirichlet products appear to pop up magically at various places in
  number theory.  Here is a simple example:

  \[
    \varphi(n) = \sum_{d \mid n} \mu(d) \frac{n}{d}.
  \]

  Therefore in the notation of Dirichlet products, the above equation
  can also be written as

  \[
    \varphi = \mu * N
  \]

  where \( N \) represents the arithmetical function \( N(n) = n \)
  for all \( n.  \)
</p>
<h3 id="hurwitz-zeta-function">Hurwitz Zeta Function</h3>
<p>
  For complex numbers \( s = \sigma + it, \) the Hurwitz zeta function
  \( \zeta(s, a) \) is initially defined for \( \sigma &gt; 1 \) as

  \[
    \zeta(s, a) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(n + a)^s}
  \]

  where \( a \) is a fixed real number, \( 0 &lt; a &lt; 1.  \) Then
  by analytic continuation, it is defined for \( \sigma \le 1 \) as

  \[
    \zeta(s, a) = \Gamma(1 - s)I(s, a)
  \]

  where \( \Gamma \) represents the gamma function

  \[
    \Gamma(s) =  \int_0^{\infty} x^{s - 1} e^{-x} \, dx
  \]

  defined for \( \sigma &gt; 0 \) and also defined, by analytic
  continuation, for \( \sigma \le 0 \) except for \( \sigma = 0, -1,
  -2, \dots \) (the nonpositive integers) and \( I(s, a) \) is defined
  by the contour integral

  \[
    I(s, a) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_C \frac{z^{s-1} e^{az}}{1 - e^z} \, dz
  \]

  where \( 0 &lt; a \le 1 \) and the contour \( C \) is a loop around
  the negative real axis composed of three parts \( C_1, \) \( C_2, \)
  and \( C_3 \) such that for \( c &lt; 2\pi, \) we have \( z =
  re^{-\pi i} \) on \( C_1 \) and \( z = re^{\pi i} \) on \( C_3 \) as
  \( r \) varies from \( c \) to \( +\infty, \) and \( z = ce^{i
  \theta} \) on \( C_2, \) \( -\pi \le \theta \le \pi.  \)
</p>
<p>
  Now admittedly, the definition or the analytic continuation of
  Hurwitz zeta function may seem very heavy and obscure to the
  uninitiated and it <em>is</em> indeed quite heavy.  It takes 6 pages
  in chapter 12 to build the prerequisite concepts before we arrive at
  this definition.  It is evident that this definition uses other
  concepts like the gamma function, a specific contour integral, etc.
  and it is only natural to expect that one has to gain sufficient
  expertise with the gamma function and contour integrals before the
  Hurwitz zeta function begins to feel intuitive.
</p>
<p>
  But once we have established the analytic continuation of the
  Hurwitz zeta function, many insightful facts about the Riemann zeta
  function follow readily.  It is easy to see that the Riemann zeta
  function can be defined in terms of the Hurwitz zeta function as

  \[
    \zeta(s) = \zeta(s, 1) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s}.
  \]

  Yes, the \( \zeta \) symbol is overloaded: \( \zeta(s, a) \) is the
  Hurwitz zeta function whereas \( \zeta(s) \) is the Riemann zeta
  function.  This relationship between the Riemann zeta function and
  the Hurwitz zeta function along with the analytic continuation of
  the Hurwitz zeta function opens new doors into the wonderful world
  of complex numbers and let us obtain beautiful and profound facts
  about the Riemann zeta function such as the fact that it has zeros
  at negative even integers, i.e., \( \zeta(n) = 0 \) for \( n = -2,
  -4, -6, \dots \) and the fact that \( \zeta(0) = -\frac{1}{2} \) and
  \( \zeta(-1) = -\frac{1}{12} \) and so on.
</p>
<p>
  I believe beautiful results like these obtained by digging deep into
  complex analysis are what makes the study of analytic number theory
  so rewarding.
</p>
<h2 id="the-next-meeting">The Next Meeting</h2>
<p>
  The next meeting is coming up today in a few hours.  Are we planning
  anything special for the 100th meeting?
</p>
<p>
  I think the 100th meeting is a significant milestone in our journey
  of understanding the beautiful and interesting gems hidden away in
  the subject of analytic number theory.  This milestone has been
  possible only due to the sustained curiousity and eagerness among
  the members of the group to learn a significant area of mathematics
  and learn it well.  We have reached this milestone successfully due
  to the passion and love for mathematics that drive the regular
  members to join these meetings and go through a few pages of the
  book everyday.  In these meetings, we have read 12 chapters
  consisting of over 250 pages so far.  Many of us knew nothing about
  analytic number theory merely five months ago and now we can
  appreciate the Riemann zeta function at a deeper level.  We now
  understand what the Riemann hypothesis really means.  This has been
  a great journey so far.
</p>
<p>
  Despite being a significant milestone and cause for celebration, we
  are going to keep our 100th meeting fairly simple.  We will continue
  where we left off yesterday.  Today we have some more relationships
  between the gamma function and the Riemann zeta function to go
  through, so that is what we will do.  We will also show that \(
  \zeta(0) = -\frac{1}{2} \) and \( \zeta(-1) = -\frac{1}{12} \) using
  the analytic continuation of the Hurwitz zeta function today.
