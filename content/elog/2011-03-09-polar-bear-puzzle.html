  Alice asked Bob, "A bear walked 1 km south, then 1 km west, then 1
  km north, and it was back at the point from where it started.  What
  colour was the bear most likely to be?"
</p>
<p>
  Bob thought for a while, could not arrive at an answer, and gave up.
  Alice explained, "Well, the answer is white.  It is a polar bear.
  It is only when you start from the North Pole that after travelling
  1 km south, 1 km west, and 1 km north you would end up at the point
  where you started."
</p>
<p>
  Bob replied, "That is an interesting solution.  Now that I
  understand your solution, I realise that there are other starting
  points apart from the North Pole where one could walk 1 km south,
  then 1 km west, and then 1 km north to return to the starting
  point."
</p>
<p>
  Can you find all the other such starting points that Bob is talking
  about?

  See the comments page for the solution.
