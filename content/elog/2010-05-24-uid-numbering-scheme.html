      <strong>Process for De-duplication</strong> (page 5):
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Since biometric information contain no ordering and hence cannot
      be indexed like text based information, when a resident applies
      for a UID with his/her fingerprints, iris and photo of face,
      these biometrics have to be compared against the entire UID
      database (existing residents with UIDs) to ensure that this new
      applicant is indeed unique and has not already been allotted a
      UID (even under a different name, address etc).  This 1:N
      biometric comparison (N=size of the UID database) is the most
      compute intensive operation of the UID server systeem.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      It sounds as if the search operation would take O(N) time.  Why
      can't the data be treated as binary numbers that can be ordered
      and indexed?  It'll improve the search time to at least O(log N)
      time and possibly even further to O(1) time if a hashtable is
      used.  The performance improvement is going to be huge since N
      is as large as 1.2 billion.

      <strong>Memorisation of UID</strong> (page 6):
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      This section is about how long the string length should be.  In
      short, the string has to be as short as possible but that meets
      density requirement and does not include alphabet characters,
      just numbers.  It is important to keep the UID simple and small
      to help residents to remember their number.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      Firstly the use of the hindu-arabic numeral
      system(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) is suggested since these numerals
      are recognised/used by the largest subset of people in the
      country.  Secondly we suggest the use of 12 digits (11 + 1 check
      sum) since 11 digits gives us a 100 billion number space which
      in turn can provide a low density of used numbers.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I don't think a 12 digit UID is easy to memorise.  However, I
      agree that this length is necessary to ensure unique UIDs for a
      large population like India's.  The population of India is about
      1.2 billion now.  Now issuing 1.2 billion UIDs from a maximum
      possible space of 100 billion numbers implies that any UID
      chosen at random has a 1.2% probability of being a valid UID
      issued to someone.  In other words, 1 out of every 83 possible
      UID values is a valid UID issued to someone.  Therefore, these
      UIDs should not be treated as secret.  It should be assumed that
      an adversary can easily guess valid UIDs issued to actual
      residents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that this problem gets worse as the population of India
      grows.  Currently, it is growing at the rate of about 1.4% every
      year.  The growth rate is expected to slow down in future.  For
      now, I will assume that the growth rate is never going to exceed
      1.4% to get a conservative estimate.  Then by the year 2050, the
      population of India would not exceed 2.1 billion.  Then the
      probability that a randomly generated UID is an actual UID
      issued to a resident would increase to 2.1%.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, any critical operation performed using a UID must
      perform an independent verification, such as two-factor
      authentication, SMS-based verification, etc. to ensure that the
      operation is approved by the actual resident the UID is issued
      to.

      <strong>UID static PIN and dynamic PIN</strong> (page 7):
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      In order to authenticate (ascertain it is who s/he claims to be) a
      resident needs to provide his/her UID number as well as say a
      biometric marker â€“ such as a fingerprint.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Using biometrics while issuing UIDs may be fine.  But using
      biometrics for other important transactions might put the
      resident at risk.  For example, see this BBC news story:
      <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050528103727/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4396831.stm">Malaysia Car Thieves Steal Finger</a>.

      <strong>Principles and Requirements</strong> (page 11):
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Number Generation: The numbers are generated in a random,
      non-repeating sequence.  There are several approaches to doing
      this in the computer science literature.  The algorithm and any
      "seed" chosen to generate IDs should not be made public and
      should be considered a national secret.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This violates Shannon's maxim, "The enemy knows the system."
      The security of the system must rely on the secrecy of the seed
      only.  It must not depend on the secrecy of the algorithm.
      Further, as explained in point 2 above, an adversory can
      randomly generate 12 digit number with a high likelihood of it
      being an actual UID to a resident.

      <strong>The Checksum</strong> (page 12):
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      There is one scheme that meets our requirements: the Verhoeff
      Scheme.  This scheme is relatively complex, and in the days
      before ubiquitous computing, there was a tendency to avoid it in
      favor of simpler schemes.  In this day and age however, and at
      the scale of the UID, precision must be the goal.  The Verhoeff
      scheme catches all single errors and all adjacent
      transpositions.  It also catches >95% of twin errors and >94% of
      jump transpositions.

  <strong>Update on 31 May 2010:</strong> After an email conversation
  with Nandan Nilekani about the points I have documented in this blog
  post, he requested that I send these points in the form a document
  to him so that he can have it reviewed by his team.  I have done so
  today.
