  This arrangement is based on the popular melody of the nursery rhyme
  called <em>Twinkle, twinkle, little star</em>.  The melody is played
  with the treble notes of the piano.  I wrote the bass notes for the
  piano and the strings, and the high notes for the pad and the music
  box to fill the music with emotions of love and happiness.  I
  recorded this after about two hours of practice.
