This is my second attempt at composing music. This piece consists of 147
measures. It is approximately 4 minutes 28 seconds long.

The mental image I had while composing this piece was that of a guy,
sitting alone in a dark night, waiting for the night to pass and the
dawn to arrive. 0:00&ndash;1:30 of the piece represents the night.
1:30&ndash;2:15 is the time when the darkness starts fading away and the
sky turns red. Everything after 2:15 is about welcoming and enjoying the
dawn.

For me this mental image doesn't just represent a particular night
passing away due to the rotation of our planet. It represents how we
should handle tough times, heartbreaks, loss, etc. in our personal
lives. We should remain calm, wait for tough times to pass and good
times to come, and when the bad times give way to good times again, we
should welcome and enjoy the good times.
