  This is my second attempt at composing music.  This piece consists
  of 147 measures.  It is approximately 4 minutes 28 seconds long.

  The mental image I had while composing this piece was that of a guy,
  sitting alone in a dark night, waiting for the night to pass and the
  dawn to arrive.  0:00&ndash;1:30 of the piece represents the night.
  1:30&ndash;2:15 is the time when the darkness starts fading away and
  the sky turns red.  Everything after 2:15 is about welcoming and
  enjoying the dawn.

  For me this mental image doesn't just represent a particular night
  passing away due to the rotation of our planet.  It represents how
  we should handle tough times, heartbreaks, loss, etc. in our
  personal lives.  We should remain calm, wait for tough times to pass
  and good times to come and when the bad times give way to good times
  again, we should welcome and enjoy the good times.
