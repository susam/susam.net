  It is likely well known among Emacs users that the following key
  sequence starts a search-and-replace operation to match strings with
  the regular expression pattern <code>f..</code> and replace the
  matches with <code>bar</code>.
</p>
<pre><code>C-M-% f.. RET bar RET</code></pre>
<p>
  Similarly, the following key sequence looks for strings that match a
  pattern that has two capturing groups and replaces each match with a
  new string that swaps the substrings matched by the capturing
  groups:
</p>
<pre><code>C-M-% \(f..\)-\(b..\) RET \2-\1</code></pre>
<p>
  For example, this operation matches a string
  like <code>foo-bar</code> and replaces it with <code>bar-foo</code>.
  A string like <code>postfix-boxing</code> becomes
  <code>postbox-fixing</code>.  The backreference <code>\1</code>
  refers to the string matched by the first capturing
  group <code>\(f..\)</code> and similarly <code>\2</code> refers to
  the string matched by the second capturing
  group <code>\(b..\)</code>.  The replacement string then swaps the
  positions of the matches in both capturing groups.
</p>
<p>
  What may be less commonly known is the ability to utilise Elisp
  expressions to dynamically compute portions of the replacement
  strings.  To employ this feature, simply write <code>\,</code>
  (i.e. backslash and comma) followed by the Elisp expression in the
  replacement string.  Consider the following key sequence:
</p>
<pre><code>C-M-% f.. RET \,(upcase \&amp;) RET</code></pre>
<p>
  The backreference <code>\&amp;</code> refers to the whole match.  We
  pass it as the argument to the Elisp function <code>upcase</code>.
  This function converts its argument to upper-case.  This example
  searches for strings that match the pattern <code>f..</code> and
  replaces each match with the upper-case form of the match.  A string
  like <code>foo-bar</code> is replaced with <code>FOO-bar</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Here is another slightly more sophisticated example:
</p>
<pre><code>C-M-% host:\([0-9]+\) RET host:\,(+ 1000 \#1)</code></pre>
<p>
  The backreference <code>\#1</code> refers to the string matched by
  the first capturing group <code>\([0-9]+\)</code> as
  a <em>number</em>.  The Elisp expression in the replacement pattern
  simply adds <code>1000</code> to that number and replaces the
  matched string with the result.  A string like <code>host:80</code>
  becomes <code>host:1080</code>.  Another string like
  <code>localhost:8000</code> becomes <code>localhost:9000</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, here is an example from the real world of text editing
  where this feature was useful to me recently while solving a text
  editing problem.  Consider the following text buffer with a list of
  numbered items:
</p>
<pre>
<code>### 1) apple
### 2) ball
### 3) bat
### 4) cat
### 5) dog
### 6) elephant
### 7) fish
### 8) grapes
### 9) hen
### 10) ink
### 11) jug
### 12) kite
### 13) lion</code>
</pre>
<p>
  While this is a toy example presented here for the sake of
  simplicity and clarity, this example is based on an actual text
  editing problem I encountered recently.  In my actual problem
  though, there were more words on each line and there were some
  arbitrary paragraphs of text between every consecutive pair of
  items.  Further, the list was long with 50 or so items.  The problem
  now was to remove item number 3 and renumber all the lines below it.
</p>
<p>
  It is quite straightforward to remove item 3.  Just move the point
  (cursor) to that line and type <code>C-S-&lt;backspace&gt;</code>
  or <code>C-a C-k</code> to kill that line.  We get this:
</p>
<pre>
<code>### 1) apple
### 2) ball
### 4) cat
### 5) dog
### 6) elephant
### 7) fish
### 8) grapes
### 9) hen
### 10) ink
### 11) jug
### 12) kite
### 13) lion</code>
</pre>
<p>
  How do we now renumber all the items starting from <code>4)
  cat</code>?  This is where the support for Elisp expressions in
  replacement strings turns out to be useful.  First move the point to
  the beginning of that line.  Then type the following key sequence:
</p>
<pre><code>C-M-% ^### \([0-9]+\) RET ### \,(1- \#1) RET</code></pre>
<p>
  The search pattern captures the item number on each line in a
  capturing group.  The replacement string contains an Elisp
  expression that subtracts one from this number.  Thus a string
  like <code>### 4</code> gets replaced with <code>### 3</code>.
  After completing the replacement, the buffer looks like this:
</p>
<pre>
<code>### 1) apple
### 2) ball
### 3) cat
### 4) dog
### 5) elephant
### 6) fish
### 7) grapes
### 8) hen
### 9) ink
### 10) jug
### 11) kite
### 12) lion</code>
</pre>

  I hope this was useful.  Do you have an interesting
  Elisp-in-replacement-string story?  Please share it in the comments.
