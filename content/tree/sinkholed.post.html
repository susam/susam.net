<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>
  On 26 Nov 2019 at 14:55 UTC, I logged into my server that hosts my
  website to perform a simple maintenance activity.  Merely three
  minutes later, at 14:58 UTC, the domain
  name <a href="https://susam.in/">susam.in</a> used to host this
  website was transferred to another registrant without any
  authorisation by me or without any notification sent to me.  Since
  the DNS results for this domain name was cached on my system, I was
  unaware of this issue at that time.  It would take me three days to
  realise that I had lost control of the domain name I had been using
  for my website for the last 12 years.  This blog post documents when
  this happened, how this happened and what it took to regain control
  of this domain name.

<p>
  On 29 Nov 2019 at 19:00 UTC, when I visited my website hosted at
  <a href="https://susam.in">https://susam.in/</a>, I found that a
  zero-byte file was being served at this URL.  My website was
  missing.  In fact, the domain name resolved to an IPv4 address I was
  unfamiliar with.  It did not resolve to the address of my Linode
  server anymore.
</p>
<p>
  I checked the WHOIS records for this domain name.  To my
  astonishment, I found that I was no longer the registrant of this
  domain.  An entity named The Verden Public Prosecutor's Office was
  the new registrant of this domain.  The WHOIS records showed that
  the domain name was transferred to this organisation on 26 Nov 2019
  at 14:58 UTC, merely three minutes after I had performed my
  maintenance activity on the same day.  Here is a snippet of the
  WHOIS records that I found:

<p>
  The ellipsis denotes some records I have omitted for the sake of
  brevity.  There were three things that stood out in these records:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    The registrar was changed from eNom, Inc. to NIXI Special Projects.
  </li>
  <li>
    The registrant was changed from Susam Pal to The Verden Public
    Prosecutor's Office.
  </li>
  <li>
    The name servers were changed from Linode's servers to
    Shadowserver's sinkholes.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="avalanche-botnet">Avalanche Botnet</h2>
<p>
  On searching more about the new registrant on the web, I realised
  that it was a German criminal justice body that was involved in the
  takedown of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_(phishing_group)">Avalanche</a>
  malware-hosting network.  It took a four-year concerted effort by
  INTERPOL, Europol, the Shadowserver Foundation, Eurojust, the
  Luneberg Police and several other international organisations to
  finally destroy the Avalanche botnet on 30 Nov 2016.  In this list
  of organisations, one name caught my attention immediately: The
  Shadowserver Foundation.  The WHOIS name server records pointed to
  Shadowserver's sinkholes.
</p>
<p>
  The fact that the domain name was transferred to another
  organisation merely three minutes after I had performed a simple
  maintenance activity got me worried.  Was the domain name hijacked?
  Did my maintenance activity on the server have anything to do with
  it?  What kind of attack one might have pulled off to hijack the
  domain name?  I checked all the logs and there was no evidence that
  anyone other than me had logged into the server or executed any
  command or code on it.  Further, a domain name transfer usually
  involves email notification and authorisation.  None of that had
  happened.  It increasingly looked like that the three minute
  interval between the maintenance activity and the domain name
  transfer was merely a coincidence.
</p>
<p>
  More questions sprang up as I thought about it.  The Avalanche
  botnet was destroyed in 2016.  What has that got to do with the
  domain name being transferred in 2019?  Did my server somehow become
  part of the Avalanche botnet?  My server ran a minimal installation
  of the latest Debian GNU/Linux system.  It was always kept
  up-to-date to minimise the risk of malware infection or security
  breach.  It hosted a static website composed of static HTML files
  served with Nginx.  I found no evidence of unauthorised access of my
  server while inspecting the logs.  I could not find any malware on
  the system.
</p>
<p>
  The presence of Shadowserver sinkhole name servers in the WHOIS
  records was a good clue.  Sinkholing of a domain name can be done
  both malicously as well as constructively.  In this case, it looked
  like the Shadowserver Foundation intended to sinkhole the domain
  name constructively, so that any malware client trying to connect to
  my server nefariously would end up connecting to a sinkhole address
  instead.  My domain name was sinkholed!  The question now was: Why
  was it sinkholed?
</p>
<h2 id="support-ticket">Support Ticket</h2>
<p>
  On 29 Nov 2019 at 19:29 UTC, I submitted a support ticket to
  Namecheap to report this issue.  At 21:05 UTC, I received a response
  from Namecheap support that they have contacted Enom, their upstream
  registrar, to discuss the issue.  There was no estimate for when a
  resolution might be available.
</p>
<p>
  At 21:21 UTC, I submitted a domain name
  <a href="https://forms.icann.org/en/resources/compliance/complaints/transfer/form">transfer complaint</a>
  to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).  I
  was not expecting any response from ICANN because they do not have any
  contractual authority on a country code top-level domain (ccTLD).
</p>
<p>
  At 21:23 UTC, I emailed National Internet Exchange of India (NIXI).
  NIXI is the ccTLD manager for .IN domain and they have authority on
  it.  I found their contact details from
  the <a href="https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db/in.html">IANA
  Delegation Record for .IN</a>.  Again, I was not expecting a
  response from NIXI because they do not have any contractual
  relationship directly with me.  They have a contractual relationship
  with Namecheap, so any communication from them would be received by
  Namecheap and Namecheap would have to pass that on to me.
</p>
<p>
  At 21:30 UTC, ICANN responded and said that I should contact the
  ccTLD manager directly.  Like I explained in the previous paragraph,
  I had already done that, so there was nothing more for me to do
  except wait for Namecheap to provide an update after their
  investigation.  By the way, NIXI never replied to my email.
</p>
<h2 id="tweets-and-retweets">Tweets and Retweets</h2>
<p>
  On 30 Nov 2019 at 07:30 UTC, I
  <a href="https://twitter.com/susam/status/1200678538254393345">shared
  this issue on Twitter</a>.  I was hoping that someone who had been
  through a similar experience could offer some advice.  In fact, soon
  after I posted the tweet, a kind person named Max from Germany
  generously
  <a href="https://twitter.com/LTE_Max/status/1200699507631112193">offered
  to help</a> by writing a letter in German addressed to the new
  registrant which was a German organisation.  The reason for
  sinkholing my domain name was still unclear.  I hoped that with
  enough number of retweets someone closer to the source of truth
  could shed some light on why and how this happened.
</p>
<p>
  At 09:54 UTC, Richard Kirkendall, founder and CEO of Namecheap,
  <a href="https://twitter.com/NamecheapCEO/status/1200714718610153472">responded</a>
  to my tweet and informed that they were contacting NIXI regarding
  the issue.  This seemed like a good step towards resolution.  After
  all, the domain name was no longer under their upstream registrar
  named Enom.  The domain name was now with NIXI as evident from
  the <a href="#whois">WHOIS records</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Several other users tweeted about my issue, added more information
  about what might have happened and retweeted my tweet.
</p>
<p>
  On 1 Dec 2019 at 11:48 UTC, Benedict Addis from the Shadowserver
  Foundation contacted me by email.  He said that they had begun
  looking into this issue as soon as one of the tweets about this
  issue had referred to their organisation.  He explained in his email
  that my domain name was sinkholed accidentally as part of their
  Avalanche operation.  Although it is now three years since the
  initial takedown of the botnet, they still see over 3.5 million
  unique IP addresses connecting to their sinkholes everyday.
  Unfortunately, their operation inadvertently flagged my domain name
  as one of the domain names to be sinkholed because it matched the
  pattern of command and control (C2) domain names generated by a
  malware family named Nymaim, one of the malware families hosted on
  Avalanche.  Although, they had validity checks to avoid sinkholing
  false-positives, my domain name unfortunately slipped through those
  checks.  Benedict mentioned that he had just raised this issue with
  NIXI and requested them to return the domain name to me as soon as
  possible.
</p>
<h2 id="domain-name-return">Domain Name Return</h2>
<p>
  On 2 Dec 2019 at 04:00 UTC, when I looked up the WHOIS records for
  the domain name, I found that it had been returned to me already.
  At 08:37 UTC, Namecheap support responded to my support ticket to
  say that they had been informed that NIXI had returned the domain
  name to its original state.  At 09:55 UTC, Juliya Zinovjeva, Domains
  Product Manager of Namecheap,
  <a href="https://twitter.com/JuliyaZinovjeva/status/1201439676118290432">commented
  on Twitter</a> and confirmed the same thing.
</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  Despite the successful resolution, it was still quite unsettling
  that a domain name could be transferred to another registrant and
  sinkholed for some perceived violation.  I thought there would be
  more checks in place to confirm that a perceived violation was real
  before a domain name could be transferred.  Losing a domain name I
  have been using actively for 12 years was an unpleasant experience.
  Losing a domain name accidentally should have been a lot harder than
  this.  Benedict from the Shadowserver Foundation assured me that my
  domain name would be excluded from future sinkholing for this
  particular case.  However, the possibility that this could happen
  again due to another unrelated operation by another organisation in
  future is disconcerting.
</p>
<p>
  I also wondered if a domain name under a country code top-level
  domain (ccTLD) like .in is more susceptible to this kind of
  sinkholing than a domain name under a generic top-level domain
  (gTLD) like .com.  I asked Benedict if it is worth migrating my
  website from .in to .com.  He replied that in his personal opinion,
  NIXI runs an excellent, clean registry and are very responsive in
  resolving issues when they arise.  He also added that domain
  generation algorithms (DGAs) of malware are equally or possibly even
  more problematic for .com domains.  He advised against migrating my
  website.

  Namecheap), Namecheap support team and Benedict Addis from the
  Shadowserver Foundation for contacting NIXI to resolve this issue.

  <em>
    <strong>Update on 06 Jan 2022:</strong> Nearly two years after
    this incident, I eventually moved this website to
    <a href="https://susam.net/">susam.net</a>.  The decision to do
    so was not influenced by this incident.  I wanted this domain name
    since 2006 but it was unavailable back then.  This domain name
    became available only very recently and I moved my website to this
    domain as soon as it became available.
