  I am a strong proponent of running independent personal websites on
  your own domains and publishing your writing there.  Doing so keeps
  the web diverse and decentralised, rather than concentrating most
  writing and discussion inside a small number of large platforms.  It
  gives authors long term control over their work without being
  subject to changing policies or incentives.  I think that a web made
  up of many small, individually run websites is more resilient and
  also more interesting than one dominated by a handful of social
  media services.

  I often participate in discussions pertaining to authoring personal
  websites because this is an area I am passionate about.  Any
  discussion about authoring websites that I take part in seems to
  drift, sooner or later, into tooling.  Aspiring personal website
  authors worry at length about which blogging engine to use, which
  static site generator to pick, which templating language to choose
  and so on.  I think none of this is important until you have
  published at least five articles on your website.  Just write plain
  HTML and worry about tooling later.
</p>
<p>
  This very website you are reading right now began its life as a
  loose collection of HTML files typed into Notepad on a Windows 98
  machine.  I wrote some text, wrapped it in basic markup and copied
  it to my web server's document root directory.  That's it.  Tooling
  came much later, in fact many years later.  As the number of pages
  grew, I naturally wanted some consistency.  I wanted a common layout
  for my pages, navigation links, a footer that did not need to be
  edited in twenty places.  The first version of this website used
  HTML frames to accomplish these goals.  Later, I rewrote the website
  in PHP.  All of this came later, after I had been maintaining this
  website for several years.  None of this was required to begin.
</p>

  Around 2006, when blogging had already become quite fashionable, I
  reorganised a large portion of this website into a chronological
  list of posts.  I added an RSS feed and adopted some of the
  conventions that people now associate with blogs.  Even so, the
  transformation was never total.  To this day, many pages remain as
  loose documents, scattered in various <a href="links.html">corners</a>
  of this website, never folded into the blog format at all.  My point
  is that not everything needs to belong to a blog.  Not every website
  needs to be a blog.  A website can just as well be a collection of
  pages, arranged in whatever way makes sense to you.  The blog is
  merely one possible organising principle, not a requirement.  If
  your goal is to share your thoughts on your personal web space, then
  worrying about blogging and tooling can become counterproductive.
  Just write your posts first, in plain HTML if need be.
</p>
<p>
  If you truly dislike writing HTML, that is fine too.  Write in
  Markdown, AsciiDoc or whatever plain text format you find pleasant
  and convert it to HTML using Pandoc or a similar tool.  Yes, I am
  slightly undermining my own advice here by talking about tooling to
  make your writing process enjoyable is reasonable.  Tooling should
  exist to reduce friction, not to become the main event.  Personally,
  I write all my posts directly in HTML.  I do not mind it at all.  In
  fact, I enjoy it.  But if you do not, it is easy to run your
  Markdown files through a converter and publish the result with only
  a little extra tooling overhead.
</p>
<p>
  It is easy to spend days and weeks polishing a website setup,
  selecting the perfect generator, theme and deployment pipeline, only
  to end up with a beautifully engineered website whose sole content
  is a single 'hello world' post.  That might not be very useful to
  you or anyone else, unless setting up the pipeline itself was your
  goal.  By contrast, a scrappy website made up of standalone HTML
  pages might be useful to you as well as others.  You can refer back
  to it months later.  You can send someone a link.  You can build on
  it gradually.  Even if you never turn it into a blog, never add RSS,
  never migrate to the latest tooling, it still fulfills its most
  important purpose: it exists and it says something you wanted to
  say.
</p>
<p>
  So to summarise my post here: Create the website.  Publish
  something.  Do it in the simplest way that lets you get your words
  onto the page and onto the web.  Once you have content that you care
  about, tooling can follow.  Your thoughts, your ideas, your
  personality and quirks are the essence of your website.  Everything
  else is optional.
