  I am a strong proponent of running
  <a href="https://hnpwd.github.io/">independent personal websites</a>
  on your own domains and publishing your writing there.  Doing so
  keeps the web diverse and decentralised, rather than concentrating
  most writing and discussion inside a small number of large
  platforms.  It gives authors long term control over their work
  without being subject to
  <a href="attention-media-is-not-social-media.html">changing policies
  or incentives</a>.  I think that a web made up of many small,
  individually run websites is more resilient and also more
  interesting than one dominated by a handful of social media
  services.

  I often participate in discussions pertaining to authoring personal
  websites because this is an area I am passionate about.  Any
  discussion about authoring websites that I take part in seems to
  drift, sooner or later, into tooling.  Aspiring personal website
  authors worry at length about which blogging engine to use, which
  static site generator to pick, which templating language to choose
  and so on.  I think none of this is important until you have
  published at least five articles on your website.  Just write plain
  HTML and worry about tooling later.
</p>
<p>
  This very website you are reading right now began its life as a
  loose collection of HTML files typed into Notepad on a Windows 98
  machine.  I wrote some text, wrapped it in basic markup and copied
  it to my web server's document root directory.  That's it.  Tooling
  came much later, in fact many years later.  As the number of pages
  grew, I naturally wanted some consistency.  I wanted a common layout
  for my pages, navigation links, a footer that did not need to be
  edited in twenty places.  An early version of this website used HTML
  frames to accomplish these goals.  Later, I rewrote the website in
  PHP.  Now this website is generated using Common Lisp.  All of these
  additions came later, after I had been maintaining this website for
  several years.  None of this was required to begin.

  Around 2006, when blogging had become quite fashionable, I
  experimented with blogging too.  Eventually, I returned to a loose,
  chaotic collection of pages.  I do have an
  <a href="./{{ index }}">index page</a> and an <a href="feed.xml">RSS
  feed</a> that resemble a blog, but they are simply a list of
  selected pages arranged in reverse chronological order.  The pages
  themselves are scattered across various
  <a href="links.html">corners</a> of this website.  My point is that
  not every website needs to be a blog.  A website can just as well be
  a collection of pages, arranged in whatever way makes sense to you.
  The blog is merely one possible organising principle, not a
  requirement.  If your goal is simply to share your thoughts on your
  own web space, worrying about blogging and tooling can easily become
  counterproductive.  Just write your posts first, in plain HTML if
  need be.

  If you truly dislike writing HTML, that is fine too.  Write in
  Markdown, AsciiDoc or whatever plain text format you find pleasant
  and convert it to HTML using Pandoc or a similar tool.  Yes, I am
  slightly undermining my own point here but I think a little bit of
  tooling to make your writing process enjoyable is reasonable.
  Tooling should exist to reduce friction, not to become the main
  ceremony.  Personally, I write all my posts directly in HTML.  I use
  Emacs, which provides a number of convenient key sequences and
  functions that make writing HTML very comfortable.  For example, it
  takes only a few keystrokes in Emacs to wrap text in a
  <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> element, insert a code block or
  close any open tags.  But that is just me.  I enjoy writing HTML
  documents in Emacs.  If you do not, it is easy to run your Markdown
  files through a converter and publish the result with only a little
  extra tooling overhead.

<p>
  It is easy to spend days and weeks polishing a website setup,
  selecting the perfect generator, theme and deployment pipeline, only
  to end up with a beautifully engineered website whose sole content
  is a single 'hello world' post.  That might not be very useful to
  you or anyone else, unless setting up the pipeline itself was your
  goal.  By contrast, a scrappy website made up of standalone HTML
  pages might be useful to you as well as others.  You can refer back
  to it months later.  You can send someone a link.  You can build on
  it gradually.  Even if you never turn it into a blog, never add RSS
  or never add any tooling, it still fulfills its most important
  purpose: it exists and it says something you wanted to say.
</p>
<p>
  So to summarise my post here: Create the website.  Publish
  something.  Do it in the simplest way that lets you get your words
  onto the page and onto the web.  Once you have content that you care
  about, tooling can follow.  Your thoughts, your ideas, your
  personality and quirks are the essence of your website.  Everything
  else is optional.
