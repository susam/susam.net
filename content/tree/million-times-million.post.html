  Is a million times a million a <em>billion</em> or is it
  a <em>trillion</em>?  For my entire childhood, it was a billion,
  only for me to grow up and realise, as an adult, that it had better
  be a trillion!
</p>
<h2 id="growing-up-with-the-long-scale">Growing Up With the Long Scale</h2>
<p>
  As a child, I stumbled upon an old dictionary lying around our house
  and that was where I discovered the names of large numbers.  The
  dictionary used the long scale system, which is based on powers of a
  million.  According to the long scale system,
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    a million times a million is a billion,
  </li>
  <li>
    a million times a million times a million is a trillion,
  </li>
  <li>
    a million multiplied by itself four times is a quadrillion,
  </li>
  <li>
    multiply it five times and we get a quintillion
  </li>
  <li>
    and so on.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  These long scale names made a lot of sense to me.  Each name told us
  exactly how many times we multiplied a million by itself.  The
  little prefix at the start, like <em>bi-</em>, <em>tri-</em>,
  <em>quadri-</em>, <em>quinti-</em>, etc. matched the number of times
  a million appeared in the multiplication: twice for a billion, three
  times for a trillion and so on.  If I came across a number like
  quintillion, I immediately knew it meant a million multiplied by
  itself five times, so a quintillion had to be \( (10^6)^5 =
  10^{30} \).  It was simple and intuitive.
</p>
<p>
  Now imagine my disappointment when I left home for university, got
  access to computers and the World Wide Web and discovered that the
  names I had learnt were off by several orders of magnitude compared
  with what everyone else was using.  The long scale names I had grown
  up with were irrelevant in this new world I was stepping into.  It
  was the short scale that had taken over most of the technology
  world, especially in computing.  In the short scale, a million times
  a million is no longer a billion.  Instead, somehow, it is a
  trillion!  Similarly, a million multiplied three times is no longer
  a trillion.  It is a quintillion!  What on earth was going on?
</p>
<p>
  Naturally, I had to go through a period of adjustment, letting go of
  my old intuition for the long scale names and getting used to the
  short scale ones.  At the same time, I found a way to trick my mind
  into making sense of the short scale.  Before I get into the mental
  gymnastics that made the short scale click for me, let us first take
  a quick look at the long scale and short scale names side by side.
</p>
<h2 id="same-names-different-numbers">Same Names, Different Numbers</h2>
<p>
  The long scale and short scale are simply two different ways of
  naming large numbers.  To see how they differ, here is a table
  showing what each name corresponds to in the two systems.
</p>
<table class="grid center">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Number</th>
      <th>Long Scale</th>
      <th>Short Scale</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>\( 10^6 \)</td>
      <td>Million</td>
      <td>Million</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>\( 10^9 \)</td>
      <td>Milliard</td>
      <td>Billion</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>\( 10^{12} \)</td>
      <td>Billion</td>
      <td>Trillion</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>\( 10^{15} \)</td>
      <td>Billiard</td>
      <td>Quadrillion</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>\( 10^{18} \)</td>
      <td>Trillion</td>
      <td>Quintillion</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>Trilliard</td>
      <td>Sextillion</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>\( 10^{24} \)</td>
      <td>Quadrillion</td>
      <td>Septillion</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>Quadrilliard</td>
      <td>Octillion</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>\( 10^{30} \)</td>
      <td>Quintillion</td>
      <td>Nonillion</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>\( 10^{33} \)</td>
      <td>Quintilliard</td>
      <td>Decillion</td>
    </tr>

<p>
  As the table shows, the two systems agree on the value of a million,
  but diverge immediately after.  From that point on, the same names
  represent increasingly different magnitudes.
</p>
<h2 id="making-sense-of-the-short-scale">Making Sense of the Short Scale</h2>
<p>
  I used to quite like the long scale names because the prefix in each
  name is determined by how many times we multiply a million by
  itself.  Each prefix reflects the value of \( n \) in the number \(
  10^{6n} \), where \( n \) is a positive integer.  For example, if \(
  n = 3 \), we get \( 10^{18} \), which in the long scale is called
  a <em>trillion</em>.  But in the short scale, the same number is
  called a <em>quintillion</em>.  How can we make sense of it?
</p>
<p>
  One way to interpret the short scale is to count how many additional
  thousands are multiplied onto one thousand.  A thousand is, of
  course, just <em>one thousand</em>.  Multiply it by another thousand
  and we get a <em>million</em>.  Multiply that by another thousand
  and we get a <em>billion</em>.  One more multiplication gives us
  a <em>trillion</em> and so on.  I do not find this quite as neat as
  the long scale but it works.
</p>
<p>
  In effect, the prefix in the short scale corresponds to \( n \) of
  the integer \( 1000 \times 1000^n \), where \( n \) is a positive
  integer.  Stated more succinctly, it represents \( n \) of \(
  10^{3(n + 1)} \).  So for example, if \( n = 5 \), then

  \[
    10^{3(n + 1)} = 10^{18},
  \]

  which is called a <em>quintillion</em> in the short scale.  The
  <em>quinti-</em> prefix still represents five but now it is tied to
  the number of additional thousands we multiplied to the first
  thousand.  It is not quite the elegant pattern I grew up with but
  this is the convention that dominates today.  In the world of
  technology, computing and finance, as well as in most
  English-speaking contexts, the short scale has prevailed.
</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  Today, of course, I use only the short scale, because that is the
  convention adopted by the part of the world relevant to me.  I no
  longer use the long scale.  But it remains in memory, simply because
  I spent a large part of my early life with it.  It still lives in
  some corner of my heart, partly out of nostalgia and partly due to
  its elegance.
