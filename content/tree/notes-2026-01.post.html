  In these monthly notes, I jot down ideas and references I
  encountered during the month that I did not have time to expand into
  their own posts.  A few of these may later develop into independent
  posts but most of them will likely not.  In any case, this format
  ensures that I record them here.  I spent a significant part of this
  month studying the book <em>Algebraic Graph Theory</em> by Godsil
  and Royle, so many of the notes here are about it.  There are a few
  non-mathematical, technical notes towards the end.

<h2 id="cayley-graphs">Cayley Graphs</h2>
<p>
  Let \( G \) be a group and let \( C \subseteq G \) such that \( C \)
  is closed under taking inverses and does not contain the identity,
  i.e., \[ \forall x \in C, \; x^{-1} \in C, \qquad e \notin C.  \]
  Then the Cayley graph \( X(G, C) \) is the graph with the vertex set
  \( V(X(G, C)) \) and edge set \( E(X(G, C)) \) defined by

  \begin{align*}
    V(X(G, C)) &amp;= G, \\
    E(X(G, C)) &amp;= \{ gh : hg^{-1} \in C \}.
  \end{align*}

  The set \( C \) is known as the connection set.
</p>
<h2 id="vertex-transitive-graphs">Vertex Transitive Graphs</h2>
<p>
  A graph \( X \) is <em>vertex transitive</em> if its automorphism
  group acts transitively on its set of vertices \( V(X) \).
  Intuitively, this means that no vertex has a special role.  We can
  'move' the graph around so that any chosen vertex becomes any other
  vertex.  In other words, all vertices are indistinguishable.  The
  graph looks the same from each vertex.
</p>
<p>
  The \( k \)-cube \( Q_k \) is vertex transitive.  So are the Cayley
  graphs \( X(G, C) \).  However the path graph \( P_3 \) is not
  vertex transitive since no automorphism can send the middle vertex
  of valency \( 2 \) to an end vertex of valency \( 1 \).
</p>
<h2 id="arc-transitive-graphs">Arc-Transitive Graphs</h2>
<p>
  The cube \( Q_3 \) is \( 2 \)-arc transitive but not \( 3 \)-arc
  transitive.  In \( Q_3 \), a \( 3 \)-arc belonging to a \( 4
  \)-cycle cannot be sent to a \( 3 \)-arc that does not belong to a
  \( 4 \)-cycle.  This is easy to explain.  The end vertices of a \( 3
  \)-arc belonging to a \( 4 \)-cycle are adjacent but the end
  vertices of a \( 3 \)-arc not belonging to a \( 4 \)-cycle are not
  adjacent.  Therefore, no automorphism can map the end vertices of
  the first \( 3 \)-arc to those of the second \( 3 \)-arc.
</p>
<p>
  For intuition, imagine that a traveller stands on a vertex and
  chooses an edge to move along.  They do this \( s \) times thereby
  walking along an arc of length \( s \), also known as an \( s
  \)-arc.  By the definition of \( s \)-arcs, the traveller is not
  allowed to backtrack from one vertex to the previous one
  immediately.  In an \( s \)-arc transitive graph, these arcs look
  the same no matter which vertex they start from or which edges they
  choose.  In the cube, this is indeed true for \( s = 2 \).  All arcs
  of length \( 2 \) are indistinguishable.  No matter which arc of
  length \( 2 \) the traveller has walked along, the graph would look
  the same from their perspective at each vertex along the arc.
  However, this no longer holds good for arcs of length \( 3 \) since
  there are two distinct kinds of arcs of length \( 3 \).  The first
  kind ends at a distance of \( 1 \) from the starting vertex of the
  arc (when the arc belongs to a \( 4 \)-cycle).  The second kind ends
  at a distance \( 3 \) from the starting vertex of the arc (when the
  arc does not belong to a \( 4 \)-cycle).  Therefore the cube is not
  \( 3 \)-arc transitive.
</p>
<h2 id="bipartite-graphs-and-cycle-parity">Bipartite Graphs and Cycle Parity</h2>
<p>
  A graph is bipartite if and only if it contains no cycles of odd
  length.  Equivalently, every cycle in a bipartite graph has even
  length.  Conversely, if every cycle in a graph has even length, then
  the graph is bipartite.
</p>
<h2 id="tutte-theorem">Tutte's Theorem</h2>
<p>
  For any \( s \)-arc transitive cubic graph, \( s \le 5 \).  This was
  demonstrated by W. T. Tutte in 1947.  A proof can be found in
  Chapter 18 of <em>Algebraic Graph Theory</em> by Norman Biggs.
</p>
<p>
  In 1973, Richward Weiss established a more general theorem that
  proves that for any \( s \)-arc transitive graph, \( s \le 7 \).
  The bound is weaker but it applies to all graphs rather than only to
  cubic ones.
</p>
<h2 id="tutte-8-cage">Tutte's 8-Cage</h2>
<p>
  The book <em>Algebraic Graph Theory</em> by Godsil and Royle offers
  the following two descriptions of Tutte's 8-cage on 30 vertices:
</p>
<blockquote>
  Take the cube and an additional vertex \( \infty \).  In each set of
  four parallel edges, join the midpoint of each pair of opposite
  edges by an edge, then join the midpoint of the two new edges by an
  edge, and finally join the midpoint of this edge to \( \infty \).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  Construct a bipartite graph \( T \) with the fifteen edges as one
  colour class and the fifteen \( 1 \)-factors as the other, where
  each edge is adjacent to the three \( 1 \)-factors that contain it.
</blockquote>
<p>
  It can be shown that both descriptions construct a cubic bipartite
  graph on \( 30 \) vertices of girth \( 8 \).  It can be further
  shown that there is a unique cubic bipartite graph on \( 30 \)
  vertices with girth \( 8 \).  As a result both descriptions above
  construct the same graph.
</p>
<h2 id="lcg">Linear Congruential Generator</h2>
<p>
  Here is a simple linear congruential generator (LCG) implementation
  in JavaScript:
</p>
<pre><code>function srand (seed) {
  let x = seed
  return function () {
    x = (1664525 * x + 1013904223) % 4294967296
    return x
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>
  Here is an example usage:
</p>
<pre><samp>&gt; <kbd>const rand = srand(0)</kbd>
undefined
&gt; <kbd>rand()</kbd>
1013904223
&gt; <kbd>rand()</kbd>
1196435762
&gt; <kbd>rand()</kbd>
3519870697</samp></pre>
<h2 id="cat-n">Numbering Lines</h2>
<p>
  Both BSD and GNU <code>cat</code> can number output lines with
  the <code>-n</code> option.  For example:
</p>
<pre><samp>$ <kbd>printf 'foo\nbar\nbaz\n' | cat -n</kbd>
     1  foo
     2  bar
     3  baz</samp></pre>
<p>
  However I have always used <code>nl</code> for this.  For example:
</p>
<pre><samp>$ <kbd>printf 'foo\nbar\nbaz\n' | nl</kbd>
     1  foo
     2  bar
     3  baz</samp></pre>
<p>
  While <code>nl</code> is
  <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/nl.html">specified
  in POSIX</a>, the <code>cat -n</code> option
  <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/cat.html">is
  not</a>.

</p>
