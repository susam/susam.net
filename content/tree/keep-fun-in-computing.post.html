  Here is a famous quote by Alan J. Perlis taken from
  the <em>Dedication</em> section of the book <em>Structure and
  Interpretation of Computer Programs</em>, 2nd ed. (1996) written by
  Harold Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman and Julie Sussman.

<blockquote>
  I think that it's extraordinarily important that we in computer
  science keep fun in computing.  When it started out, it was an awful
  lot of fun.  Of course, the paying customers got shafted every now
  and then, and after a while we began to take their complaints
  seriously.  We began to feel as if we really were responsible for
  the successful, error-free perfect use of these machines.  I don't
  think we are.  I think we're responsible for stretching them,
  setting them off in new directions, and keeping fun in the house.  I
  hope the field of computer science never loses its sense of fun.
