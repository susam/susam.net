#+title: Org Mode Startup Overview Demo

* Introduction
This document demonstrates an Org mode feature.

* Code Blocks
This section presents a few code examples.

** Hello World Program
Here is a code block with the famous "hello, world" program written in
C:

#+begin_src c
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main()
  {
      printf("hello, world\n");
      return 0;
  }
#+end_src

** Running the Program
On a Unix or Unix-like system, this program can be compiled to a binary
executable with the following command:

#+begin_example
  $ cc hello.c && ./a.out
  hello, world
#+end_example

* Quotes
Issac Newton was relatively modest about his achievements, writing in a
letter to Robert Hooke in February 1676:

#+begin_quote
If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.
#+end_quote

In a later memoir, Newton wrote:

#+begin_quote
I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to
have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting
myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell
than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered
before me.
#+end_quote
