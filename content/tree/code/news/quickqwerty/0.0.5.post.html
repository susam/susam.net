<p>
  An initial draft of QuickQWERTY, a touch typing tutor that runs in
  the web browser, is now available on SourceForge at
  <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/quickqwerty/">sourceforge.net/projects/quickqwerty/</a>.
  This release includes 15 units with a total of 73 typing lessons
  designed for QWERTY keyboards.
</p>
<p>
  This draft is version 0.5.0 of the tutor.  As the version number
  suggests, it is the fifth revision of the software.  The first four
  were internal releases shared only with friends, who tested the
  software for several months.  Their feedback helped uncover and fix
  a number of issues.  Version 0.5.0 marks the first public release of
  QuickQWERTY.

<p>
  Over the coming months, I plan to expand the software with
  additional typing lessons.
