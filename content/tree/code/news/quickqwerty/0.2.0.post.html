<p>
  Version 0.2.0 of QuickQWERTY is now available.  The number row has
  been adjusted so that keys <code>1</code> to
  <code>5</code> are now typed with the left hand, and keys
  <code>6</code> to <code>0</code> with the right hand.  In addition,
  the minimum speed requirement for moving to the next lesson has been
  removed, giving learners greater flexibility in their practice.

<p>
  These changes make QuickQWERTY more consistent with standard typing
  conventions and more adaptable to different learning speeds.
