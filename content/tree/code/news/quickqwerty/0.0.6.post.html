<p>
  Version 0.0.6 of QuickQWERTY, a touch typing tutor that runs in the
  web browser, is now available.  This update focuses on improving
  compatibility with Internet Explorer.
</p>
<p>
  In this release, trailing commas were removed from
  <code>db.js</code>, as they caused errors in Internet Explorer 6 and
  7.  An issue was also fixed that led to an extra unit appearing in
  the unit list when the tutor was used in Internet Explorer.
</p>
<p>
  With these fixes, QuickQWERTY should now run more smoothly across
  different browsers.
