  QuickQWERTY 1.2.1 is now available.  QuickQWERTY is a web-based
  touch typing tutor for QWERTY keyboards that runs directly in the
  web browser.
</p>
<p>
  This release contains a minor bug fix in Unit 4.3.  Unit 4.3 is a
  'Control' unit that lets you practise typing partial words as well
  as full words. In one place in this unit, the following sequence of
  partial and full words occurs:
</p>
<pre><code>l li lime lime</code></pre>
<p>
  The full word <code>lime</code> was incorrectly repeated twice.
  This has been fixed to:
</p>
<pre><code>l li lim lime</code></pre>
