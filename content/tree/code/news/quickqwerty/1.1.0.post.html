<p>
  There has been a new release of QuickQWERTY after over 10 years!
  QuickQWERTY is a web-based touch typing tutor for QWERTY keyboards
  that runs directly in the web browser.  You can try it out
  here: <a href="../../../quickqwerty.html">quickqwerty.html</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The new release, version 1.1.0 of QuickQWERTY, introduces a new
  input command named <code>reset</code>, which is a synoymn for the
  existing commands <code>restart</code> and <code>rst</code> used to
  restart the current lesson.  Another input command
  named <code>test</code> runs an internal suite of tests to validate
  that no lesson involves keys that have not been introduced in the
  current or prior lessons.  Further, in this release, the application
  has been fully rewritten as a single standalone HTML file with no
  external dependencies, and the source code has been greatly
  simplified.
</p>
<p>
  There are a number of other changes too.  Words per minute (WPM)
  calculation has been refined so the first character, which starts
  the timer, is not counted.  The guides have been enhanced.  Keys to
  be pressed are now highlighted more clearly, and reminders to return
  fingers to their home positions have been added to each guide.  The
  confirmation dialogue for switching between 6-7 split and 5-6 split
  styles now uses the HTML <code>&lt;dialog&gt;</code> element,
  replacing the dated <code>window.confirm()</code> prompt.  In
  addition, when the application is opened without a fragment
  identifier in the URL, the most recently practised lesson loads
  automatically.
</p>
<p>
  The user interface has been simplified.  The previous and next links
  (<code>&laquo;</code> and <code>&raquo;</code>) for navigating
  lessons have been removed, as they added little value and made the
  layout of the various user interface components more complex.  The
  "Next lesson" advice link remains for moving to the next lesson when
  the current one is completed successfully.  Tooltips showing
  additional typing metrics have also been removed due to limited
  usefulness.
</p>
<p>
  The lessons have been updated to remove spellings specific to
  American English.  Care has been taken to use only words that are
  spelled the same in American and British English with one exception.
  The word "tyre" with its British English spelling has remained in
  the lesson by oversight.  That will be fixed in the next release.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, QuickQWERTY's license has changed from the BSD-2-Clause
  licence to the MIT licence.  The source code is available at
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/quickqwerty">github.com/susam/quickqwerty</a>.
