  Guess My RGB 0.1.0 is the first stable release
  of <a href="../../../myrgb.html">this tiny colour guessing game</a>.
  The game is available as a single HTML page that runs in a web
  browser.  It presents a page with a randomly chosen background
  colour.  The player then needs to guess the three RGB hexademical
  digits that make the given background colour.  See
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/myrgb">github.com/susam/myrgb</a>
  for more information about this game.

  I wrote this game last Saturday afternoon and shared it on my
  website at <a href="../../../myrgb.html">myrgb.html</a> later that
  night.  I had no intention of sharing this with a wide audience yet
  because I had not had sufficient time testing it well.  But somehow
  a Hacker News (HN) user named <em>talonx</em> discovered this game
  on Sunday morning and shared it on HN in this post:
  <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39882018">news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39882018</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Since I had not shared this game with anyone anywhere yet, I was
  quite surprised to wake up Sunday morning and find my game trending
  at the top of HN.  I believe this is where maintaining an RSS feed
  on my website might have helped.  Every new page that I publish on
  this website also appears as an entry in the RSS feed for this
  website.  This feed can be found
  here: <a href="../../../feed.xml">feed.xml</a>.  I have a couple of
  hundred subscribers to this feed.  It is very likely that the HN
  user who shared this game on HN found it through this feed.
</p>
<p>
  Ever since this game was shared on HN, my website has received a
  large number of hits.  In the last three days (excluding today),
  this game has received a total of 166102 hits.  The actual numbers
  for each day look like this:

  To all visitors of this website who played this game and shared this
  game with others, thank you!  Crafting tiny software tools like this
  is a creative outlet for me.  To know that there are others out
  there who enjoyed this game brings me joy!
