  <a href="../../../myrgb.html">Guess My RGB</a>, the little colour
  guessing game, received a minor update today.  This update adds a
  hidden feature that lets you play the game in <em>expert mode</em>.
  In this mode, the match percentage for your submitted guess is not
  shown on the screen.
</p>
<p>
  Thanks to @steffahn for

  this feature</a> on th Lobsters forum!
</p>
<p>
  Visit <a href="../../../myrgb.html#x">myrgb.html#x</a> now to play
  the game in the expert mode.
</p>
<p>
  Alternatively, visit <a href="../../../myrgb.html">myrgb.html</a> to
  play it in the normal mode like before.
