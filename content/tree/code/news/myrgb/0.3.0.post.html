<p>
  <a href="../../../myrgb.html">Guess My RGB</a>, the little colour
  guessing game, just got a small update.  This update adds a
  "Mode" link to the footer which can be used to toggle the game
  between normal mode and expert mode.
</p>
<p>
  The expert mode was introduced as a hidden feature five months ago
  in the <a href="0.2.0.html">previous release</a>.  With the current
  release, the expert mode no longer remains a hidden feature.  You
  can simply toggle between modes via the new footer link.
