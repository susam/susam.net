<p>
  MathB 1.3.0 is likely the final update of MathB, a web-based
  mathematics pastebin service.  The online mathematics pastebin
  service previously hosted at <code>https://mathb.in/</code> has been
  shut down today after 13 years of continuous service.  See the post
  <a href="../../../mathbin-is-shutting-down.html">MathB.in Is
  Shutting Down</a> for more details about this.  This release
  captures the state of this project as it was today at the time of
  shutting down the online service.
</p>
<p>
  This update includes a few new features.  For example, there is now
  a configurable runtime property named <code>:expect</code> that can
  be used to enforce the presence of certain tokens in the posts
  submitted by the users.  This feature was used to enforce the
  presence of LaTeX delimiters in the online service, a measure that
  was instrumental in reducing spam to a great extent in the last few
  years.  There are a few other minor changes too.
  See <a href="https://github.com/susam/mathb/blob/main/CHANGES.md">CHANGES.md</a>
  for a detailed changelog.

<p>
  The source code of MathB remains free and open-source, so anyone
  interested in hosting their own instance can still do so.  To access
