<p>
  MathB 0.2.0 is a minor update of MathB, a web-based mathematics
  pastebin service.  The key change in this release is the removal of
  image support.  Image tags are now disallowed in new posts, and
  older posts containing images will no longer be rendered.  This
  update aims to mitigate spam on the live service
  at <code>https://mathb.in/</code>.
