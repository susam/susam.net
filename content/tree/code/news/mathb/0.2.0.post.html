<p>
  MathB 0.2.0 is a minor update of MathB, a web-based mathematics
  pastebin service.  The key change in this release is the removal of
  image support.  Image tags are now disallowed in new posts and older
  posts containing images will no longer be rendered.  This update
  aims to mitigate spam on the live instances of this software.
