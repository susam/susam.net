  MathB 1.1.0 is a minor update of MathB, a web-based mathematics
  pastebin service.

  This release introduces a few additional features for webmasters
  hosting MathB on their own web servers.  Notably, administrators can
  now ban specific IP addresses, helping mitigate spam attacks from
  known sources.  Additionally, the included Nginx configuration has
  been updated to fix a memory leak issue.  Several other minor fixes
  and improvements are also included.
