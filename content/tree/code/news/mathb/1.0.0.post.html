<p>
  MathB 1.0.0 is the first major release of MathB since 2012, bringing
  significant updates to this web-based mathematics pastebin service.
</p>
<p>
  The most notable change is a complete rewrite in Common Lisp,
  replacing the original PHP codebase.  This shift reflects my
  preference for Lisp, a language I truly enjoy.  It also makes the
  project easier for me to maintain actively.
</p>
<p>
  This release introduces the use of the
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/texme">TeXMe</a> parser to
  robustly parse and render posts written using Markdown and LaTeX.
  Further, now there is support for dark colour scheme for systems
  that have dark colour scheme enabled.  For those who host this
  service on their web servers, MathB now supports a runtime control
  file named <code>opt.lisp</code> where a number of properties of
  this service can be customised.  These customisable properties
  include maximum title length, maximum code length, minimum time
  interval between two posts, etc.  See
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/mathb/blob/main/CHANGES.md">CHANGES.md</a>
  for a detailed changelog.
