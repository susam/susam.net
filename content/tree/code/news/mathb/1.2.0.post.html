<p>
  MathB 1.2.0 is a minor update of MathB, a web-based mathematics
  pastebin service.
</p>
<p>
  This release introduces a number of new customisable properties,
  including the ability to set a minimum title length, minimum code
  length, etc.  The stylesheet for rendered pages has been improved so
  that the print preview displays only the rendered mathematical
  content, allowing users to print beautifully rendered pages to
  paper.  A few rendering bug fixes are included too.
