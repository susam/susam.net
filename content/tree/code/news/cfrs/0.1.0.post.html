<p>
  CFRS[] 0.1.0 is the first release of CFRS[], an extremely minimal
  drawing language that consists of only six simple commands.  Ever
  since this new esoteric language and its implementation was
  <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37956065">announced
  about two months ago</a>, a small but enthusiastic community has
  sprung up around it.  Feedback and enhancement requests from the
  community has been crucial in polishing the implementation and
  arriving at the current stable release.  Further, some community
  members have also submitted very interesting and impressive demos.
