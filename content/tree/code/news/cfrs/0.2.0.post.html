<p>
  CFRS[] 0.2.0 is a minor update of CFRS[], an extremely minimal
  drawing language consisting of only 6 simple commands.  This update
  brings minor changes to the built-in help screen that can be invoked
  by typing <code>?</code> in the input pane.  For example, the help
  screen now has a direct links to built-in demos and community demos.
  Further, based on community feedback, the description of
  the <code>]</code> command has been updated with clearer language
  that better clarifies that this command repeats a repeatable block
  once (i.e., executes the repeatable block again).  See
  the <a href="https://github.com/susam/cfrs/blob/main/CHANGES.md">changelog</a>
  for more details.
