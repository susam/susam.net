  CFRS[] 0.3.0 is a minor update of CFRS[], an extremely minimal
  drawing language consisting of only 6 simple commands.  This update
  fixes an annoying bug that caused CFRS[] canvas to overflow the
  visible screen on some mobile web browsers.  In particular, this
  issue was observed on Chrome running on Samsung Galaxy S8.
