<p>
  MVS 0.1.0 is a minimal implementation of the Mark V. Shaney program
  written in 32 lines of Python. Mark V. Shaney was a synthetic Usenet
  user in the 1980s that posted messages to newsgroups using text
  generated by a Markov chain program.  See the Wikipedia
  article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_V._Shaney">Mark
  V. Shaney</a> for more details.

  This release introduces the program
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/mvs/blob/main/mvs.py">mvs.py</a>
  that implements a similar Markov text generator program.  It
  consumes the content of a file named
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/mvs/blob/main/book.txt">book.txt</a>,
  builds an internal model and then uses the model to generate
  gibberish.
