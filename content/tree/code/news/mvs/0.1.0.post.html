<p>
  Mark V. Shaney Junior is a minimal implementation of a Markov
  gibberish generator inspired by the legendary Mark V. Shaney program
  from the 1980s.  Mark V. Shaney was a synthetic Usenet user in the
  1980s that posted messages to newsgroups using text generated by a
  Markov chain program.  See the Wikipedia
  article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_V._Shaney">Mark
  V. Shaney</a> for more details.

  This release introduces the program
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/mvs/blob/main/mvs.py">mvs.py</a>
  that implements a similar Markov text generator.  It reads a text
  corpus of text from standard input, build an internal Markov model
  and then generate text using the model.
