<p>
  Mark V. Shaney Junior 0.2.0 is the second release of this little
  Markov gibberish generator.  This release brings two small changes.
  First, it now reads the training data from standard input instead of
  a hardcoded file.  Second, the program filename has been changed
  from <code>mvs.py</code> to <code>mvs</code> to reflect that it is
  an executable file and can be run as <code>./mvs</code> on most Unix
  and Linux systems.
