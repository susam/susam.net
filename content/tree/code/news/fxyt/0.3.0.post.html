<p>
  FXYT 0.3.0 is a minor release of FXYT, a tiny, esoteric,
  stack-based, postfix, canvas colouring language with only 36 simple
  commands.  This release comes with minor bug fixes pertaining to
  initialising the input and output from code embedded in
  distributable links.  No change in the language definition or the
  language implementation has been made in this release.
