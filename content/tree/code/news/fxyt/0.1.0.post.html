<p>
  FXYT 0.1.0 is the first release of this project that introduces the
  FXYT canvas colouring language and a reference implementation.  This
  project is inspired by Martin Kleppe's very popular Tixy project.
  While Tixy supports JavaScript expressions to determine the size and
  colour of circles in a 16x16 grid, FXYT comes with its own tiny,
  stack-based language that is written in postfix notation.  Further,
  FXYT provides a 256x256 grid of cells each of which can be painted
  with an arbitrary colour determined by the result of the evaluation
  of the input code.
