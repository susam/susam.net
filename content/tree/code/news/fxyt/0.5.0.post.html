<p>
  FXYT 0.5.0 is a minor update of FXYT, a tiny, esoteric, stack-based,
  postfix, canvas colouring language with only 36 simple commands.
  This release fixes an annoying bug that has been affecting some
  mobile device users for a while.  On some mobile web browsers, such
  as Chrome on Samsung Galaxy S8, the drawing canvas would appear to
  be larger than the viewport thus overflowing the visible screen on
  the mobile device.  The user would then be required to manually zoom
  out in order to use this tool conveniently.  This issue has been
  fixed in this release.

  If you follow my <a href="../../../cfrs.html">CFRS[]</a> project,
  you might have noticed yesterday that a very similar fix has gone
  into CFRS[] too.  For more details about that, see
  the release page for <a href="../cfrs/0.3.0.html">CFRS[] 0.3.0</a>.
