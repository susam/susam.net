<p>
  FXYT 0.4.0 is a minor update of FXYT, a tiny, esoteric, stack-based,
  postfix, canvas colouring language with only 36 simple commands.
  This release increases the maximum allowed code length from 256
  bytes to 1024 bytes.  This means there is now more room for writing
  more complex FXYT programs!
</p>
<p>
  Further, it now allows you to create distributable links for your
  demos for programs as long as 256 bytes.  The earlier limit was 64
  bytes only.  However, the community demos we have received so far
  have shown that if the maximum code length limit for distributable
  links is increased a little bit more, then some more very impressive
  demos can be shared as distributable links and that's why this limit
  has been increased to 256 bytes now.

  As a specific example of one such demo, take a look at
