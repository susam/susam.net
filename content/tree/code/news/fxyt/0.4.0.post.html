<p>
  FXYT 0.4.0 is a minor update of FXYT, a tiny, esoteric, stack-based,
  postfix, canvas colouring language with only 36 simple commands.
  This release increases the maximum allowed code length from 256
  bytes to 1024 bytes.  This means there is now more room for writing
  more complex FXYT programs!

<p>
  Further, the maximum code length for distributable demo links has
  been increased from 64 bytes to 256 bytes.  This allows several more
  impressive demos to have their own distributable links.  As a
  specific example of one such demo, take a look at
