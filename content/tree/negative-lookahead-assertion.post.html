<p>
  Here is an example of negative lookahead assertion in regular
  expression using Python:
</p>
<pre>
<code>import re
strings = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz', 'foo-bar', 'bar-baz', 'baz-foo']
matches = [s for s in strings if re.search('^(?!.*foo)', s)]
print(matches)</code>
</pre>
<p>
  The regular expression <code>^(?!.*foo)</code> in the above example
  matches strings that do not contain the pattern <code>foo</code>.
  The above code example produces the following output:
</p>
<pre><samp>['bar', 'baz', 'bar-baz']</samp></pre>
<p>
  Of course, it is much simpler to use an ordinary regular expression
  that matches <code>foo</code> and then invert the result of the
  match to ignore strings that contain <code>foo</code>.  For example,
  consider the following straightforward solution:
</p>
<pre><code>matches = [s for s in strings if not re.search('foo', s)]</code></pre>
<p>
  This example produces the same result as the earlier example but
  with less complexity.  However, there are situations where, as a
  user of certain software tool, we might not have control over how
  the tool applies the regular expression.  Some tools only allow us
  to provide a pattern and then they automatically select strings that
  match the pattern.  In such cases, if we need to select strings
  that <em>do not</em> match a given pattern, negative lookahead
  assertions become quite useful, provided the regular expression
  flavour supported by the tool allows the use of negative lookahead
  assertions.
