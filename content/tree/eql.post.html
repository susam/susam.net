<!-- title: Equal Length Words -->
<!-- tag: Miscellaneous -->
<!-- draft: yes -->
<p>
  This page contains groups of related words that are all the same
  length and related to one another in some way.  This unusual
  fascination with related words of equal length originated as a
  result of computer programming.  While developing software, I often
  need to name variables, functions, and other elements in a way that
  reflect the concepts I am working with.  Occasionally, I end up
  choosing names for related elements that are the same length, which
  becomes visually striking when these names align neatly in the text
  editor.

<p>
  Each group of words is presented in monospaced font so that the
  equal length of the words in each group is visually evident.  Blank
  spaces separate the groups.  The groups are sorted alphabetically
  according to the first word in each group.  The words in each group
  are sorted alphabetically too.
