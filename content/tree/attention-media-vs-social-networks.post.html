  When web-based social networks started flourishing nearly two
  decades ago, they were genuinely social networks.  You would sign up
  for a popular service, follow people you knew or liked and read
  updates from them.  When you posted something, your followers would
  receive your updates as well.  Notifications were genuine.  The
  little icons in the top bar would light up because someone had sent
  you a direct message or engaged with something you had posted.
  There was also, at the beginning of this millennium, a general sense
  of hope and optimism around technology, computers and the Internet.
  Social networking platforms were one of the services that were part
  of what was called Web 2.0, a term used for websites built around
  user participation and interaction.  It felt as though the
  information superhighway was finally reaching its potential.  But
  sometime between 2012 and 2016, things took a turn for the worse.

  First came the infamous infinite scroll.  I remember feeling uneasy
  the first time a web page no longer had a bottom.  Logically, I knew
  very well that everything a browser displays is a virtual construct.
  There is no physical page.  It is just pixels pretending to be one.
  Still, my brain had learned to treat web pages as objects with a
  beginning and an end.  The sudden disappearance of that end
  disturbed my sense of ease.

  Then came the bogus notifications.  What had once been meaningful
  signals turned into arbitrary prompts.  Someone you followed had
  posted something unremarkable and the platform would surface it as a
  notification anyway.  It didn't matter whether the notification was
  relevant to me.  The notification system stopped serving me and
  started serving itself.  It felt like a violation of an unspoken
  agreement between users and services.  Despite all that, these
  platforms still remained social in some diluted sense.  Yes, the
  notifications were manipulative, but they were at least about people
  I actually knew or had chosen to follow.  That, too, would change.

  Over time, my timeline contained fewer and fewer posts from friends
  and more and more content from random strangers.  Using these
  services began to feel like standing in front of a blaring
  loudspeaker, broadcasting fragments of conversations from all over
  the world directly in my face.  That was when I gave up on these
  services.  There was nothing social about them anymore.  They had
  become <em>attention media</em>.  My attention is precious to me.  I
  cannot spend it mindlessly scrolling through videos that have
  neither relevance nor substance.

<p>
  But where one avenue disappeared, another emerged.  A few years ago,
  I stumbled upon Mastodon and it reminded me of the early days of
  Twitter.  Back in 2006, I followed a small number of folks of the
  nerd variety on Twitter and received genuinely interesting updates
  from them.  But when I log into the ruins of those older platforms
  now, all I see are random videos presented to me for reasons I can
  neither infer nor care about.  Mastodon, by contrast, still feels
  like social networking in the original sense.  I follow a small
  number of people I genuinely find interesting and I receive their
  updates and only their updates.  What I see is the result of my own
  choices rather than a system trying to capture and monetise my
  attention.  There are no bogus notifications.  The timeline feels
  calm and predictable.  If there are no new updates from people I
  follow, there is nothing to see.  It feels closer to how social
  networks used to work originally.  I hope it stays that way.
