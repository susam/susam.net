  <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/HistTopics/Light_1/">Light
  Through the Ages: Ancient Greece to Maxwell</a> is a very
  fascinating article written by J J O'Connor and E F Robertson in
  2002 that takes us through a journey of how our understanding of
  light has evolved over the last few millennia.  Here is an excerpt
  from the article:
</p>
<blockquote>
  The biggest breakthrough in ancient times was made by al-Haytham
  around 1000 AD.  He argued that sight is due only to light entering
  the eye from an outside source and there is no beam from the eye
  itself.
</blockquote>

  The article then goes on to say:
</p>
<blockquote>
  He gave a number of arguments to support this claim, the most
  persuasive being the camera obscura, or pinhole camera.  Here light
  passes through a pinhole shining on a screen where an inverted image
  is observed.  Anyone visiting Edinburgh in Scotland should go to see
  the camera obscura there near the top of the Royal Mile and marvel
  at just how effective the camera obscura is in this enjoyable
  tourist attraction.
</blockquote>

  By the way, there is a camera obscura in the London too at Royal
  Observatory, Greenwich which offers pretty good view of the
  surroundings that includes Greenwich Park, the University of
  Greenwich, the River Thames, etc.  Here is a picture I took the last
  time I was there:
