  In this note I elaborate the proof of a claim regarding Cayley
  graphs of symmetric groups with transpositions as generators that I
  found in the book <em>Algebraic Graph Theory</em> by Chris Godsil
  and Gordon Royle.  This claim appears as commentary in Section 3.10
  about <em>Transpositions</em>.  Here I present it in the form of a
  theorem along with a complete proof.

  <strong>Theorem.</strong>
  <em>
    If \( \mathcal{T} \) is a set of transpositions, then the Cayley
    graph \( X(\operatorname{Sym}(n), \mathcal{T}) \) has no triangles.
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Proof.</em>  Suppose the vertices \( a, b, c \in
  \operatorname{Sym}(n) \) form a triangle in the Cayley graph \(
  X(\operatorname{Sym}(n), \mathcal{T}) \).  Since multiplication by
  \( a^{-1} \) is an automorphism of the Cayley graph (by the proof of
  Theorem 3.1.2 that comes earlier), the vertices \( e, ba^{-1},
  ca^{-1} \) form a triangle too.  Let us label them as \( e, b', c'
  \) respectively.
</p>

  Now by the definition of a Cayley graph, for any two vertices \( a,
  b \in \operatorname{Sym}(n) \), we have

  \begin{align*}
    a \sim b
    &amp; \iff ba^{-1} \in \mathcal{T} \\
    &amp; \iff ba^{-1} = g \\
    &amp; \iff b = ga
  \end{align*}

  for some \( g \in \mathcal{T} \).  Therefore

  \begin{align*}
    e \sim b'  &amp; \iff b' = ge = g, \\
    e \sim c'  &amp; \iff c' = he = h, \\
    b' \sim c' &amp; \iff c' = lb'
  \end{align*}

  for some \( g, h, l \in \mathcal{T} \).  Note that the last equality gives

  \[
    l =c'b'^{-1} = hg^{-1} = hg \in \mathcal{T}
  \]

  Therefore \( g, h, hg \in \mathcal{T} \).  However, this is
  impossible since the product of two transpositions is \( e \), a \(
  3 \)-cycle or a product of two disjoint transpositions.  For
  example, \( (12)(12) = e \), \( (12)(13) = (123) \) and \( (12)(24)
  = (12)(24) \).  Therefore \( hg \) cannot be a transposition,
  i.e. \( hg \notin \mathcal{T} \).  This is a contradiction.
  Therefore the vertices \( a, b, c \) cannot form a triangle.  We
  conclude that the Cayley graph \( X(\operatorname{Sym}(n),
  \mathcal{T}) \) has no triangles.
