  Yesterday, I was returning home from Malleswaram in an auto
  rickshaw.  It was a long ride because of the terrible Bangalore
  traffic.  At one of the places where we were stuck for a long time
  due to traffic, the auto rickshaw driver began talking to me.  To my
  pleasant surprise, he talked about poetry, history, geography,
  mathematics and biology.  He did most of the talking.  I simply
  listened and responded when I had something to add.  He was fluent
  in English and Hindi and he knew a little bit of Oriya too.  He
  learnt a little more from me.  I know Oriya as I have spent over 20
  years in Orissa.  Kannada was his mother tongue.

  For some reason, he believed that the US got its independence on 9
  July 1777 even though I told him that it was 4 July 1776.  I told
  him that I was very sure of the date as it is often used in
  Hollywood movies even though I was not sure of the year.  He also
  mentioned that one can't find water anywhere in the world that
  tastes better than that of Coimbatore.  He talked about angles and
  properties of circles when it came to mathematics.  He talked about
  bones when we talked about biology.

  He said that he never went to school but he ensured that his
  children got good education.  He explained that he learnt most of
  the things he was discussing, including Hindi and English, from his
  children.  He said that he learnt through experience that time is
  very precious and it should not be wasted.

<p>
  Finally, he explained why he was talking so much.  He offered two
  reasons:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>To beat the boredom.</li>
  <li>God resides where good ideas are discussed.</li>
</ul>
