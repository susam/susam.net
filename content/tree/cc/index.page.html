<p>
  Welcome to this computation club!  This is a tiny and informal hobby
  group that picks classics from the field of mathematics and
  computation, reads them, and discusses them together.
</p>
<h2 id="join">Join</h2>
<p>
  To join this our discussions, connect to the IRC
  network <code>irc.libera.chat:6697</code> and <code>/join
  #susam</code>.  You can also join via the following web interfaces:
</p>
<div class="highlight">
  <p>
    Libera IRC:
    <a href="https://web.libera.chat/#susam">#susam</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    Matrix room:
    <a href="https://app.element.io/#/room/#susam:matrix.org">#susam:matrix.org</a>
  </p>
</div>
<p>
  You only need to join one of these links, not both.  Messages posted
  to the IRC channel are automatically forwarded to the Matrix room
  and vice versa.  If you are not an active IRC user, prefer joining
  the Matrix bridge because it is more convenient for someone
  unfamiliar with IRC.  For example, you can close your web browser or
  client and your Matrix chat session will still stay alive on the
  server.  You can connect back later and read messages that were sent
  to the room while you were away.  Doing that with IRC requires
  slightly more work such as setting up IRC bouncers etc.
