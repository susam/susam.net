  It is not obvious from the graph that

  \[
    f(x) = \begin{cases}
    x \sin(1/x) &amp; \text{ if } x \neq 0 \\
    0           &amp; \text{ if } x = 0
    \end{cases}
  \]

  is continuous but not differentiable at \( x = 0.  \)
</p>
<h3 id="example-of-discontinuous-function">Example of Discontinuous Function</h3>
<p>
  Although the \( \sin \) function is continuous, the function

  \[
    S(x) = \frac{\sin x}{1} - \frac{\sin 2x}{2} + \frac{\sin 3x}{3} - \dots
  \]

  is discontinuous.

<h3 id="irrationality-of-square-root-of-2">Irrationality of \( \sqrt{2} \)</h3>
<p>
  Let \( \sqrt{2} = m/n \) where \( m \) and \( n \) be positive
  integers with no common factor.  Then

  \begin{align}
    (m / n)^2 = 2
    &amp; \implies m^2 = 2n^2 \notag \\
    &amp; \implies 2 \mid m^2 \notag \\
    &amp; \implies 2 \mid m \label{div1.2.1} \\
    &amp; \implies m = 2l \; \text{ for some positive integer } l \notag \\
    &amp; \implies m^2 = 4l^2 \notag \\
    &amp; \implies 2n^2 = 4l^2 \notag \\
    &amp; \implies n^2 = 2l^2 \notag \\
    &amp; \implies 2 \mid n^2 \notag \\
    &amp; \implies 2 \mid n.  \label{div1.2.2} \\
  \end{align}

  But \eqref{div1.2.1} and \eqref{div1.2.2} contradict the assumption
  that \( m \) and \( n \) have no common factor.

<h3 id="irrationality-of-non-integer-square-root-of-n">Irrationality of Non-Integer \( \sqrt{n} \)</h3>
<p>
  Let \( n \) be a natural number such that \( n \) is not a perfect
  square.  Then there exists a prime number \( p \) such that

  \[
    n = p^{2k + 1} l
  \]

  where \( k \) is a nonnegative integer, \( l \) is a positive
  integer, and \( p \nmid l.  \)  Note that the power of \( p \) cannot
  be even because \( n \) is not a perfect square.
</p>
<p>
  Let \( \sqrt{n} = r/s \) such that \( r \) and \( s \) are positive
  integers with no common factor.  Then

  \begin{align*}
  (r / s)^2 = n
  &amp; \implies r^2 = n s^2 \\
  &amp; \implies r^2 = p^{2k + 1} l s^2 \\
  &amp; \implies r^2 = p^{2k + 1} l s^2 \\
  &amp; \implies p^{2k + 1} \mid r^2.
  \end{align*}

  Since \( r^2 \) is a perfect square, \( p \) must divide it an even
  number of times.  Therefore we get,

  \begin{align}
  p^{2k + 1} \mid r^2
  &amp; \implies p^{2k + 2} \mid r^2 \notag \\
  &amp; \implies p^{k + 1} \mid r \notag \\
  &amp; \implies p \mid r.  \label{div1.2.3}
  \end{align}

  Also

  \begin{align}
    p^{2k + 2} \mid r^2
    &amp; \implies p^{k + 1} \mid r \notag \\
    &amp; \implies r = p^{k + 1} j \; \text{ for some positive integer } j \notag \\
    &amp; \implies r^2 = p^{2k + 2} j^2 \notag \\
    &amp; \implies n s^2 = p^{2k + 2} j^2 \notag \\
    &amp; \implies p^{2k + 1} l s^2 = p^{2k + 2} j^2 \notag \\
    &amp; \implies l s^2 = p j^2 \notag \\
    &amp; \implies p \mid l s^2 \notag \\
    &amp; \implies p \mid s^2 \; \text{ (since } p \nmid l \text{)} \\
    &amp; \implies p \mid s.  \label{div1.2.4}
  \end{align}

  But \eqref{div1.2.3} and \eqref{div1.2.4} contradict the assumption
  that \( r \) and \( s \) have no common factor.

<h3 id="exercise-1.1">Irrationality of \( \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3} \)</h3>
<p>
  If \( x = m / n \) where \( m \) and \( n \) are integers, then \(
  x^2 = m^2 / n ^2.  \)  We have shown that if \( x \) is rational,
  then \( x^2 \) is rational too.  Taking its contrapositive, we find
  that if \( x^2 \) is irrational, then \( x \) is irrational.
</p>
<p>
  Let \( x = \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}.  \) Then \( x^2 = 5 + 2 \sqrt{6}.
  \)  If \( x^2 = 5 + 2 \sqrt{6} = m / n \) for some integers \( m \)
  and \( n, \) then \( \sqrt{6} = (m - 5n) / 10n.  \) But this is a
  contradiction since \( \sqrt{6} \) is irrational (by the discussion
  in the previous section).  Thus \( x^2 \) is irrational.  Therefore
  \( x = \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3} \) is irrational.

<!-- Section 1.3 -->
<h2 id="1.3">&sect; 1.3 The Language of Set Theory</h2>
<h3 id="notations-for-sets">Notations for Sets</h3>
<p>
  The following notations are introduced in this section:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>\( \mathbb{N} \): the set of natural numbers (positive integers)</li>
  <li>\( \mathbb{Z} \): the set of all integers</li>
  <li>\( \mathbb{Q} \): the set of all rational numbers</li>
  <li>\( \mathbb{R} \): the set of all real numbers</li>
  <li>\( \mathbb{C} \): the set of all complex numbers</li>
</ol>
<p>
  In one of the paragraphs, the book states that

  \[
    X \cup (A \setminus X) = A
  \]

  This is not true in general but this is true when \( X \subseteq A.
  \) as is the assumption made in the book just before stating the
  above formula.  In general though, the following is true instead:

  \[
    X \cup (A \setminus X) = A \cup X.
  \]
</p>
