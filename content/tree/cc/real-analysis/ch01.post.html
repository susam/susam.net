<p>
  It is not obvious from the graph that

  \[
    f(x) = \begin{cases}
    x \sin(1/x) &amp; \text{ if } x \neq 0 \\
    0           &amp; \text{ if } x = 0
    \end{cases}
  \]

  is continuous but not differentiable at \( x = 0 \).
</p>
<h3 id="example-of-discontinuous-function">Example of Discontinuous Function</h3>
<p>
  Although the \( \sin \) function is continuous, the function

  \[
    S(x) = \frac{\sin x}{1} - \frac{\sin 2x}{2} + \frac{\sin 3x}{3} - \dots
  \]

  is discontinuous.

<h3 id="irrationality-of-square-root-of-2">Irrationality of \( \sqrt{2} \)</h3>
<p>
  Let \( \sqrt{2} = m/n \) where \( m \) and \( n \) be positive
  integers with no common factor.  Then

  \begin{align}
    (m / n)^2 = 2
    &amp; \implies m^2 = 2n^2 \notag \\
    &amp; \implies 2 \mid m^2 \notag \\
    &amp; \implies 2 \mid m \\
    &amp; \implies m = 2l \; \text{ for some positive integer } l \notag \\
    &amp; \implies m^2 = 4l^2 \notag \\
    &amp; \implies 2n^2 = 4l^2 \notag \\
    &amp; \implies n^2 = 2l^2 \notag \\
    &amp; \implies 2 \mid n^2 \notag \\
    &amp; \implies 2 \mid n.  \\
  \end{align}

  But \( 2 \mid m \) and \( 2 \mid n \) contradict the assumption
  that \( m \) and \( n \) have no common factor.
</p>
<h3 id="irrationality-of-non-integer-square-root-of-n">Irrationality of Non-Integer \( \sqrt{n} \)</h3>
<p>
  Let \( n \) be a natural number such that \( n \) is not a perfect
  square.  Then there exists a prime number \( p \) such that

  \[
    n = p^{2k + 1} l
  \]

  where \( k \) is a nonnegative integer, \( l \) is a positive
  integer and \( p \nmid l \).  Note that the power of \( p \) cannot
  be even because \( n \) is not a perfect square.
</p>
<p>
  Let \( \sqrt{n} = r/s \) such that \( r \) and \( s \) are positive
  integers with no common factor.  Then

  \begin{align*}
  (r / s)^2 = n
  &amp; \implies r^2 = n s^2 \\
  &amp; \implies r^2 = p^{2k + 1} l s^2 \\
  &amp; \implies p^{2k + 1} \mid r^2.
  \end{align*}

  Since \( r^2 \) is a perfect square, \( p \) must divide it an even
  number of times.  Therefore we get,

  \begin{align}
  p^{2k + 1} \mid r^2
  &amp; \implies p^{2k + 2} \mid r^2 \notag \\
  &amp; \implies p^{k + 1} \mid r \notag \\
  &amp; \implies p \mid r.
  \end{align}

  Also

  \begin{align}
    p^{2k + 2} \mid r^2
    &amp; \implies p^{k + 1} \mid r \notag \\
    &amp; \implies r = p^{k + 1} j \; \text{ for some positive integer } j \notag \\
    &amp; \implies r^2 = p^{2k + 2} j^2 \notag \\
    &amp; \implies n s^2 = p^{2k + 2} j^2 \notag \\
    &amp; \implies p^{2k + 1} l s^2 = p^{2k + 2} j^2 \notag \\
    &amp; \implies l s^2 = p j^2 \notag \\
    &amp; \implies p \mid l s^2 \notag \\
    &amp; \implies p \mid s^2 \; \text{ (since } p \nmid l \text{)} \\
    &amp; \implies p \mid s.
  \end{align}

  But \( p \mid r \) and \( p \mid s \) contradict the assumption that
  \( r \) and \( s \) have no common factor.
</p>
<h3 id="exercise-1.1">Irrationality of \( \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3} \)</h3>
<p>
  If \( x = m / n \) where \( m \) and \( n \) are integers, then \(
  x^2 = m^2 / n ^2 \).   We have shown that if \( x \) is rational,
  then \( x^2 \) is rational too.  Taking its contrapositive, we find
  that if \( x^2 \) is irrational, then \( x \) is irrational.
</p>
<p>
  Let \( x = \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3} \).  Then
  \( x^2 = 5 + 2 \sqrt{6} \).  If \( x^2 = 5 + 2 \sqrt{6} = m / n \)
  for some integers \( m \) and \( n \), then \( \sqrt{6} = (m - 5n) /
  10n \).  But this is a contradiction since \( \sqrt{6} \) is
  irrational (by the discussion in the previous section).  Thus
  \( x^2 \) is irrational.  Therefore \( x = \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3} \) is
  irrational.

<h2 id="1.3">&sect; 1.3 The Language of Set Theory</h2>
<h3 id="notations-for-sets">Notations for Sets</h3>
<p>
  The following notations are introduced in this section:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>\( \mathbb{N} \): the set of natural numbers (positive integers)</li>
  <li>\( \mathbb{Z} \): the set of all integers</li>
  <li>\( \mathbb{Q} \): the set of all rational numbers</li>
  <li>\( \mathbb{R} \): the set of all real numbers</li>
  <li>\( \mathbb{C} \): the set of all complex numbers</li>
</ol>
<p>
  In one of the paragraphs, the book states that

  \[
    X \cup (A \setminus X) = A
  \]

  This is not true in general but this is true when
  \( X \subseteq A \) as is the assumption made in the book just
  before stating the above formula.  In general though, the following
  is true instead:

  \[
    X \cup (A \setminus X) = A \cup X.
  \]

      \( a(b + c) = ab + ac \) for every \( a, b, c \in \mathbb{Q} \).

</ol>
<h3 id="order-axioims">Order Axioms</h3>
<p>
  The set \( \mathbb{Q} \), together with the addition and
  multiplication operations and a relation \( &lt; \) satisfy the
  order axioms presented below:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Transitive law:<br>
      For all \( a, b, c \in \mathbb{Q} \), \( a &lt; b \) and \( b

<h3 id="order-relation-in-q">Order Relation in \( \mathbb{Q} \)</h3>
<p>
  Let \( m, p \in \mathbb{Z} \) and \( n, q \in \mathbb{N} \).  Then

  \[
    \frac{m}{n} &lt; \frac{p}{q}
    \iff \frac{mq}{nq} &lt; \frac{np}{nq}
    \iff mq &lt; np.
  \]
</p>
<h3 id="density-property">Density Property</h3>
<p>
  The set \( \mathbb{Q} \) has the property of the density.  For all
  \( q, r \in \mathbb{Q} \) where \( q &lt; r \), there is \( s \in
  \mathbb{Q} \) such that \( q &lt; s &lt; r \).  This is trivial to
  demonstrate by taking \( s = (q + r) / 2 \).
</p>
<p>
  Example: Between \( 5/10 \) and \( 7/10 \), there exists \( 6/10 \),
  i.e., \( 5/10 &lt; 6/10 &lt; 7/10 \).
</p>
<p>
  There are infinitely many rational numbers between \( q \) and
  \( r \).  This follows directly from the density property.
</p>
<h3 id="archimedean-property">Archimedean Property</h3>
<p>
  For all \( q &gt; 0 \) in \( \mathbb{Q} \), there exists \( n \in
  \mathbb{N} \) such that \( n &gt; q \).
</p>
<p>
  Example: For \( q = 7/3 \), there exists \( n = 5 &gt; 7/3 \).  In
  fact, there also exists \( n = 3 &gt; 7/3 \).
</p>
<h3 id="upper-bound">Upper Bound</h3>
<p>
  A subset \( B \) of \( \mathbb{Q} \) is said to be bounded above if
  there exists an upper bound \( K \in \mathbb{Q} \) such that \( K
  \ge b \) for all \( b \in B \).
</p>
<p>
  Example: The set \( \{ a \in Q : a &lt; 4 \} \) is bounded above by
  \( 4 \).  It is also bounded above by \( 5 \), by \( 6 \), by \(
  100 \), etc.  The least upper bound is \( 4 \).
</p>
<p>
  Example: The set \( \mathbb{N} \subset \mathbb{Q} \) is not bounded
  above.
</p>
<h3 id="least-upper-bound">Least Upper Bound</h3>
<p>
  If \( B \subset \mathbb{Q} \) and \( B \ne \emptyset \) and \( B \)
  is bounded above then a least upper bound of \( B \) is a number \(
  k \in \mathbb{Q} \) such that:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    \( k \) is an upper bound of \( B \);
  </li>
  <li>
    \( c \) is an upper bound of \( B \) \( \implies \) \( c \ge k \).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Here is an equivalent definition of least upper bound purely in
  symbols without relying on the definition of "upper bound":
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    \( k \ge b \) for all \( b \in B \);
  </li>
  <li>
    \( c \) satisfies \( c \ge b \) for all \( b \in B \)
    \( \implies \) \( c \ge k \).
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="uniqueness-of-least-upper-bound">Uniqueness of Least Upper Bound</h3>
<p>
  Let \( k_1 \) and \( k_2 \) be the least upper bounds of \( B \).
</p>
<p>
  Since \( k_1 \) is a least upper bound and \( k_2 \) is an upper
  bound, we get \( k_1 \le k_2 \).
</p>
<p>
  Since \( k_2 \) is a least upper bound and \( k_1 \) is an upper
  bound, we get \( k_2 \le k_1 \).
</p>
<p>
  Thus \( k_1 = k_2 \).
</p>
<h3 id="properties-of-real-numbers">Properties of Real Numbers</h3>
<p>
  The set \( \mathbb{R} \) is an ordered field satisfying the
  following axioms:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Axiom of Archimedes: For all \( x &gt; 0 \in \mathbb{R} \), there
    exists \( n \in \mathbb{N} \) such that \( n &gt; x \).
  </li>
  <li>
    Axiom of Completeness: Every non-empty subset of \( \mathbb{R} \)
    that is bounded above has a least upper bound in \( \mathbb{R} \).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Note that the set \( \mathbb{Q} \) does not satisfy the axiom of
  completeness.  For example, the set

  \[
    C = \{ a \in \mathbb{Q} : a &gt; 0 \text{ and } a^2 &lt; 2 \}
  \]

  is a non-empty subset of \( \mathbb{Q} \) that is bounded above but
  its least upper bound is \( \sqrt{2} \notin \mathbb{Q} \).
</p>
<h3 id="greatest-lower-bound-of-r">Greatest Lower Bound</h3>
<p>
  <strong>Theorem.</strong>
  <em>
    If the set \( A \subset \mathbb{R} \) and \( A \ne \emptyset \)
    and \( A \) is bounded below, then \( A \) has a greatest lower
    bound in \( \mathbb{R} \).
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Proof.</em>  First let \( A' = \{ -a : a \in A \} \).  We will
  use this set in a moment.
</p>
<p>
  Since \( A \) is bounded below, there exists a lower bound \( k \in
  \mathbb{R} \) such that \( k \le a \) for all \( a \in A \).  Thus
  \( -k \ge -a \) all \( a \in A \).  Therefore \( -k \ge a' \) for
  all \( a' \in A' \).  Thus \( -k \) is an upper bound of \( A' \).
</p>
<p>
  We have shown that the set \( A' \) is bounded above.  Therefore by
  the axiom of completeness, \( A' \) has a least upper bound \( c \in
  \mathbb{R} \).   This means the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    \( c \) is an upper bound of \( A' \)
    (i.e., \( c \ge a' \) for all \( a' \in A' \));
  </li>
  <li>
    \( d \) is an upper bound of \( A' \) \( \implies \) \( d \ge c \)
    (i.e., \( d \) satisfies \( d \ge a' \) for all \( a' \in A' \) \(
    \implies \) \( d \ge c \)).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The above properties imply:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    \( -c \le a \) for all \( a \in A \);
  </li>
  <li>
    \( -d \) satisfies \( -d \le a \) for all \( a \in A \) \(
    \implies \) \( -d \le -c \).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Therefore \( -c \) is the greatest lower bound of \( A \).
</p>
<h3 id="supremum-and-infimum">Supremum and Infimum</h3>
<p>
  A non-empty set \( A \in \mathbb{R} \) that is bounded above has a
  least upper bound in \( \mathbb{R} \) by the axiom of completeness.
  If \( A \) is bounded below, it has a greatest lower bound in \(
  \mathbb{R} \) as demonstrated earlier.
</p>
<p>
  The least upper bound of \( A \) (when it is bounded above) is known
  as the supremum of A.  This is denoted as \( \sup A \).
</p>
<p>
  The greatest lower bound of \( A \) (when it is bounded below) is
  known as the infimum.  This is denoted as \( \inf A \).
</p>
<p>
  For open and closed intervals, we have

  \begin{align*}
    \sup (a, b) &amp; = \sup [a, b] = b, \\
    \inf (a, b) &amp; = \inf [a, b] = a.
  \end{align*}
</p>
<h3 id="irrationality-of-x-plus-y-for-x-in-Q-and-y-not-in-Q">Irrationality of \( x + y \) for \( x \in \mathbb{Q} \) and \( y \notin \mathbb{Q} \)</h3>
<p>
  If \( x \) is rational and \( y \) is irrational, then \( x + y \)
  is irrational.  To show this first let
  \( x = m/n \in \mathbb{Q} \).  Now suppose \( x + y = p/q \in
  \mathbb{Q} \).  Then

  \[
    y = \frac{p}{q} - \frac{m}{n} = \frac{pn - qm}{qn} \in \mathbb{Q}.
  \]

  This is a contradiction since \( y \) is irrational.  Therefore \( x
  + y \notin \mathbb{Q} \).
</p>
<h3 id="irrational-between-rationals">Irrational Between Rationals</h3>
<p>
  If \( x, y \in \mathbb{Q} \) and \( x &lt; y \), then there exists
  an irrational number \( u \) such that \( x &lt; u &lt; y \).
</p>
