<h2 id="starting-emacs">Starting Emacs</h2>
<p>
  Here are some frequently used commands to start Emacs:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>emacs -nw</code>: Tell Emacs not to create a graphical
    frame, i.e., run Emacs within a terminal instead.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>emacs -q</code>: Do not load an init file, i.e., do not
    load <code>~/.emacs</code>, <code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code>, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>emacs -Q</code>: Do not load init file, site-wide startup
    file or X resources.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="emacs-client-server">Emacs Client-Server</h2>
<p>
  The key sequence <code>M-x server-start RET</code> turns the current
  instance of Emacs into a server.  If we kill this instance of Emacs,
  it kills the server too.
</p>
<p>
  Another way to start an Emacs server is to enter the
  command <code>emacs --daemon</code>.  This too internally
  invokes <code>server-start</code> to start an Emacs server but this
  command ensures that Emacs runs in background mode.  Therefore,
  killing any particular instance of Emacs window does not end up
  killing the Emacs server.
</p>
<p>
  To open files, say <code>foo.txt</code> and <code>bar.txt</code> in
  an already running Emacs server, enter the command <code>emacsclient
  foo.txt bar.txt</code>.  This command blocks the terminal and waits
  for us to finish editing the files.  While editing the files, we
  need to type <code>C-x #</code> to tell Emacs that we are done
  editing the current file.  Emacs then switches to the next file we
  are editing.  When we are done editing all the files
  opened, <code>emacsclient</code> quits and returns control to the
  terminal.
</p>
<p>
  The book does not mention how to stop an Emacs daemon.  One of the
  several ways to stop an Emacs daemon is the
  command <code>emacsclient -e '(kill-emacs)'</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Here are some commands to run <code>emacsclient</code>:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>emacsclient -c</code>: Create a frame.  A graphical frame is
    created if graphics is available, otherwise a terminal frame is
    created.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>emacsclient -nw</code>: Create a terminal frame.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>emacsclient -n</code>: Client returns immediately without
    waiting for us to finish editing the file.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-emacs-interface">The Emacs Interface</h2>
<p>
  The book mentions that many Emacs users disable the menu bar, tool
  bar and the splash screen.  The following Elisp code shows how these
  UI elements can be disabled:
</p>
<pre>
<code>(menu-bar-mode 0)
(when (display-graphic-p)
  (tool-bar-mode 0)
  (scroll-bar-mode 0))
(setq inhibit-startup-screen t)</code>
</pre>
<p>
  After saving the code in the initialisation file (such
  as <code>~/.emacs</code>, <code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code>, etc.) and
  restarting Emacs, these UI elements disappear.
</p>
<p>
  It is worth mentioning here that disabling the menu bar may not be a
  good idea, especially, for beginners to Emacs.  The menu bar
  contains a lot of helpful shortcuts that could be useful to
  beginners.  Further, the menu bar often displays certain menus that
  are specific to the current buffer.  Therefore, it may be a good
  idea to leave the menu bar enabled.
</p>
<p>
  Regardless of whether the menu bar is enabled or disabled, the menu
  bar can accessed easily by typing <kbd>F10</kbd>.
</p>
<h2 id="keys">Keys</h2>
<p>
  The book mentions the following notation for modifier keys:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>C-</code>: Control</li>
  <li><code>M-</code>: Meta</li>
  <li><code>S-</code>: Shift</li>
  <li><code>s-</code>: Super</li>
  <li><code>H-</code>: Hyper</li>
  <li><code>A-</code>: Alt</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Although not mentioned in the book, here is a quick way to test out
  all of these modifier keys:
</p>
<pre>
<code>(global-set-key (kbd "C-j") (lambda () (interactive) (message "You typed C-j")))
(global-set-key (kbd "M-j") (lambda () (interactive) (message "You typed M-j")))
(global-set-key (kbd "C-S-j") (lambda () (interactive) (message "You typed C-S-j")))
(global-set-key (kbd "s-j") (lambda () (interactive) (message "You typed s-j")))
(global-set-key (kbd "H-j") (lambda () (interactive) (message "You typed H-j")))
(global-set-key (kbd "A-j") (lambda () (interactive) (message "You typed A-j")))</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Go to some buffer, say, the scratch buffer with
  <code>C-x b *scratch* RET</code>, then copy the above code to it,
  then place the cursor at the end of each line of code and
  type <code>C-x e</code> to evaluate each line.
</p>
<p>
  Then open a new buffer, say with <code>C-x b foo RET</code> and
  type <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>j</kbd>, <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>j</kbd>
  and <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>j</kbd> to test the first
  three key bindings.
</p>
<p>
  The fourth key-binding <code>s-j</code> can usually be invoked by
  typing <kbd>command</kbd>+<kbd>j</kbd>
  or <kbd>win</kbd>+<kbd>j</kbd> depending on the type of keyboard you
  have.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>H-</code> and <code>A-</code> modifier keys are generally
  not mapped to any actual key in modern systems.  However, it is
  possible to invoke the <code>H-j</code> and <code>A-j</code> key
  bindings with the key sequences <code>C-x @ h j</code> and <code>C-x
  @ a j</code>, respectively,
  i.e., <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd> <kbd>@</kbd> <kbd>h</kbd> <kbd>j</kbd>
  and <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd> <kbd>@</kbd> <kbd>a</kbd> <kbd>j</kbd>,
  respectively.
</p>
<p>
  In fact, similarly, <code>s-j</code> too can be invoked
  with <code>C-x @ s j</code>,
  i.e., <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd> <kbd>@</kbd> <kbd>s</kbd> <kbd>j</kbd>
  but that is rarely necessary because <code>s-</code> is often bound
  to a GUI key like the <kbd>command</kbd> key on Apple keyboards and
  the <kbd>win</kbd> key on Windows keyboards.
</p>
<p>
  A practical example of a real and useful <code>s-</code> key binding
  from vanilla Emacs is <code>s-u</code> to invoke
  the <code>revert-buffer</code> command that reloads a file from the
  disk.
</p>
<h2 id="terminal-limitations">Terminal Limitations</h2>
<p>
  The book mentions that there are some key bindings that we cannot
  use if we are running Emacs in the terminal.  That is because a
  terminal supports a very limited set of key bindings.  An example
  is <code>C-/</code> that invokes the <code>undo</code> command in
  GUI Emacs.  The terminal does not recognise that key sequence.
  However, the <code>undo</code> command is also bound
  to <code>C-_</code> and <code>C-x u</code>, so one of these key
  sequences can be used to undo changes in terminal Emacs.
</p>
<h2 id="definitions-for-key-sequences">Definitions for Key Sequences</h2>
<p>
  The book provides a few definitions of key sequences that can be
  summarised as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <em>Key sequence</em> (or just <em>key</em>): A sequence of
    keyboard or mouse actions, e.g., <code>C-d</code>,
    <code>C-M-d</code>, <code>C-x C-f</code>, <code>C-x 8
    P</code>, <code>C-x</code>, <code>C-x 8</code>, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Complete key</em>: A key sequence that invokes a command,
    e.g., <code>C-d</code>, <code>C-M-d</code>, <code>C-x
    C-f</code>, <code>C-x 8 P</code>, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Prefix key</em>: A key sequence that is not a complete key,
    e.g., <code>C-x</code>, <code>C-x 8</code>, etc.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="key-examples">Key Examples</h2>
<p>
  The section <em>Keys</em> presents the following examples of key
  sequences:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>C-d</code>: Calls <code>delete-char</code> which deletes the
    following character.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>C-M-d</code>: Calls <code>down-list</code> which moves
    forward down one level of parentheses.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>C-x C-f</code>: Calls <code>find-file</code> which is used
    for editing a file.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>C-x 8 P</code>: Insersts pilcrow, i.e., the symbol &para;,
    also known as the paragraph symbol.  Here both <code>C-x</code>
    and <code>8</code> are prefix keys.  There are many more key
    bindings available under the <code>C-x 8</code> prefix.  For
    example, <code>C-x 8 C</code> inserts the copyright symbol, i.e.,
    the symbol &copy;.  A set of keys like this that belong to a
    particular prefix key is called a <em>key map</em>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>C-M-%</code>: Calls <code>query-replace-regexp</code> to
    replace text with regula-expression based matching.  Since the
    key <kbd>%</kbd> is normally typed
    as <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>5</kbd>, this key sequence involves
    holding down 4 keys together,
    i.e., <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>5</kbd>.
    Annoyingly, this happens to be an example of a key sequence that
    does not work in terminal Emacs due to terminal limitations.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>TAB</code>: Calls <code>indent-for-tab-command</code> that
    either indents the current line or region or inserts a tab,
    depending on the context.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>&lt;f1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;f2&gt;</code>,
    ..., <code>&lt;f10&gt;</code>: Functions keys that invoke various
    functions.  Some of these are prefix keys while others are
    complete key sequence.  For example, <code>&lt;f1&gt;</code> is a
    prefix key that is available as an alternative to
    the <code>C-h</code> prefix key.  The key sequence <code>C-h
    m</code> shows help for the current major and minor modes and so
    does <code>&lt;f1&gt; m</code>.  However, <code>&lt;f10&gt;</code>
    is a complete key sequence that calls the
    command <code>menu-bar-open</code> that shows the menu bar.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ctrl-g">C-g: Universal Bail Me Out</h2>
<p>
  The key sequence <code>C-g</code> is used to cancel a partially
  completed command.  For example, normally, the key
  sequence <code>M-x whitespace-mode RET</code> toggles the visibility
  of whitespace in the current buffer.  However, let us say, we type
  the partial key sequence <code>M-x white</code> and then we change
  our mind about it and want to cancel entering the command any
  further, we can simply type <code>C-g</code> to
  run <code>keyboard-quit</code> that signals a quit condition and
  cancels the input.
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, say, we type <code>C-x</code> and then we change our mind
  about it and want to cancel this partially entered key sequence, we
  can simply type <code>C-g</code>.  The following message appears in
  the echo area but this is by design:
</p>
<pre><code>C-x C-g is undefined</code></pre>
<p>
  Don't let that message make you feel that you did something wrong by
  entering an undefined key sequence.  Key sequences ending
  with <code>C-g</code> have been intentionally left undefined, so
  that it can be used reliably as the universal <em>bail me out</em>
  key sequence.
</p>
<p>
  Now of course, nothing stops us from binding <code>C-x C-g</code> to
  a command of our choice.  For example, the following Elisp code
  binds it to a command that prints a message:
</p>
<pre><code>(global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-g") (lambda () (interactive) (message "You typed C-x C-g")))</code></pre>
<p>
  However, a key binding like the above one is a very bad idea because
  such a key binding flies against Emacs conventions.  If we were to
  create a key binding like the above one, we can longer rely
  on <code>C-g</code> to be our universal bail out command.  Key
  sequences ending with <code>C-g</code> are best left undefined.
</p>
<h2 id="caps-lock-as-control">Caps Lock as Control</h2>
<p>
  The book recommends configuring our operating system to make
  the <kbd>caps lock</kbd> key behave like <kbd>ctrl</kbd>.  Many
  people do find this type of remapping very convenient.  Many
  discussions can be found online where people have claimed that this
  remapping has helped with overcoming repetitive strain injury (RSI).
  However, the
  article <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MovingTheCtrlKey">Moving
  the Ctrl Key</a> on Emacs Wiki claims that for some people this
  remapping <em>causes</em> RSI.
</p>
<p>
  I use the original <kbd>ctrl</kbd> keys as they come with the
  keyboard.  Most keyboards have two <kbd>ctrl</kbd> keys on either
  side of the keyboard which I find very convenient.  I touch type
  while editing text, so the two <kbd>ctrl</kbd> keys on either side
  of the keyboard turn out to be really useful.  For example, when I
  need to type <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd>, I can hold
  down <kbd>ctrl</kbd> with the little finger of the right hand and
  type <kbd>a</kbd> with the little finger of the left hand.
  Similarly, if I need to type <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd>, I can
  hold down <kbd>ctrl</kbd> with the little finger of the left hand
  and type <kbd>p</kbd> with the little finger of the right hand.
  Using the original <kbd>ctrl</kbd> keys offers this advantage of
  distributing the usage of the <kbd>ctrl</kbd> to both hands.
  However, some Apple keyboards provide only a single <kbd>ctrl</kbd>
  key on the left hand side which can be quite annoying to touch
  typists.  In such keyboards, remapping the <kbd>caps lock</kbd> key
  to behave like <kbd>ctrl</kbd> key can indeed be more convenient.
</p>
<h2 id="M-x-execute-extended-command">M-x: Execute Extended Command</h2>
<p>
  The key sequence <code>M-x</code> is pronounced <em>mex</em>, <em>M
  x</em> or <em>meta x</em>.  It invokes the
  command <code>execute-extended-command</code> that brings up a
  minibuffer to read a command name and execute it.
</p>
<p>
  When <code>M-x</code> key sequences are presented in written form,
  often they may be written in a precise manner that includes
  the <code>M-x</code> key sequence, then the command name and finally
  the <code>RET</code> key in the end, e.g., <code>M-x lunar-phases
  RET</code>.  But sometimes they may also be written without
  the <code>RET</code> key, e.g., <code>M-x lunar-phases</code>.
  The <code>RET</code> key is automatically implied in the latter
  form.
</p>
<h2 id="interactive-commands">Interactive Commands</h2>
<p>
  The following function written in Elisp is interactive:
</p>
<pre>
<code>(defun hello ()
  (interactive)
  (message "hello"))</code>
</pre>
<p>
  However, the following function is not interactive:
</p>
<pre>
<code>(defun hola ()
  (message "hola"))</code>
</pre>
<p>
  The <code>(interactive)</code> expression declares a function as
  interactive which allows it to be called interactively
  using <code>M-x</code>.
</p>
<p>
  To see the difference between the two functions, copy both functions
  to some buffer, say, the scratch buffer and then put the cursor
  after the closing parentheses of each function and type <code>C-x
  C-e</code> to evaluate the <code>defun</code> expressions thus
  defining the functions.  After doing so, <code>M-x hello RET</code>
  executes the <code>hello</code> function and produces the "hello"
  message in the echo area.  However, typing <code>M-x hola RET</code>
  produces no match for a function named <code>hola</code>.
</p>
<h2 id="m-x-execute-extended-command-for-buffer">M-X: Execute Extended Command for Buffer</h2>
<p>
  Emacs 28 introduces <code>M-X</code> that runs the
  command <code>execute-extended-command-for-buffer</code>.  The book
  mentions this key binding as <code>M-S-x</code> which is in
  fact <code>M-X</code>.  In these notes, we'll write <code>M-X</code>
  for consistency with how this key sequence is actually defined and
  represented in Emacs (for example, note that <code>C-h k
  M-S-x</code> shows the key as <code>M-X</code>).
</p>
<p>
  To see how this function works, first open a file,
  say, <code>foo.el</code> with <code>C-x C-f foo.el RET</code>, then
  type <code>M-x e RET</code>.  A large list of function names
  beginning with the letter "e" as choices appears.  Now
  type <code>M-X e RET</code>.  A much smaller list of choices that
  are relevant for the current Elisp buffer appears.
</p>
<h2 id="universal-arguments">Universal Arguments</h2>
<p>
  Universal arguments are also called <em>prefix arguments</em>.  The
  list below presents some examples of complete key sequences where we
  apply various prefix arguments to the key sequence <code>C-n</code>.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>C-u C-n</code>: Move cursor down 4 lines.</li>
  <li><code>C-u C-u C-n</code>: Move cursor down 16 lines.</li>
  <li><code>C-u C-u C-u C-n</code>: Move cursor down 64 lines.</li>
  <li><code>C-u 5 C-n</code>: Move cursor down 5 lines.</li>
  <li><code>C-u 15 C-n</code>: Move cursor down 15 lines.</li>
  <li><code>C-5 C-n</code>: Move cursor down 5 lines.</li>
  <li><code>C-1 C-5 C-n</code>: Move cursor down 15 lines.</li>
  <li><code>C-- C-n</code>: Move cursor up 1 line.</li>
  <li><code>C-- C-5 C-n</code>: Move cursor up 5 lines.</li>
  <li><code>C-- C-1 C-5 C-n</code>: Move cursor up 15 lines.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Note that negative arguments (the last three examples above)
  reverses the direction of operation.  The digit arguments of the
  form <code>C-&lt;digit&gt;</code> can also be entered
  using <code>M-&lt;digit&gt;</code>
  or <code>C-M-&lt;digit&gt;</code>.  Here are some examples:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>M-5 C-n</code>: Move cursor down 5 lines.</li>
  <li><code>C-M-5 C-n</code>: Move cursor down 5 lines.</li>
  <li><code>M-1 M-5 C-n</code>: Move cursor down 15 lines.</li>
  <li><code>C-M-1 C-M-5 C-n</code>: Move cursor down 15 lines.</li>
  <li><code>M-- C-n</code>: Move cursor up 1 line.</li>
  <li><code>M-- M-5 C-n</code>: Move cursor up 5 lines.</li>
  <li><code>M-- M-1 M-5 C-n</code>: Move cursor up 15 lines.</li>
  <li><code>C-M-- C-n</code>: Move cursor up 1 line.</li>
  <li><code>C-M-- C-M-5 C-n</code>: Move cursor up 5 lines.</li>
  <li><code>C-M-- C-M-1 C-M-5 C-n</code>: Move cursor up 15 lines.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  While entering multiple digits in a digit argument, we can also mix
  and match modifier keys as shown below, however doing so would be
  pointless and unwieldy:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>C-1 M-5 C-n</code>: Move cursor down 15 lines.</li>
  <li><code>C-1 C-M-5 C-n</code>: Move cursor down 15 lines.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The reason why Emacs supports entering digit arguments or negative
  arguments with all three modifier
  combinations <code>C-</code>, <code>M-</code>, <code>C-M-</code>, is
  so that we can choose a modifier that is convenient.  Usually, this
  would be the modifier we anticipate that we'll use next for the
  command we are prefixing with the digit or negative argument.  For
  example, if we are going to move forward by 5 words, then <code>M-5
  M-f</code> is going to be more convenient than <code>C-5 M-f</code>
  or <code>C-M-5 M-f</code>.  To type <code>M-5 M-f</code>, we can
  simply press and hold down <kbd>alt</kbd>, then type <kbd>5</kbd>
  followed by <kbd>f</kbd> and finally release <kbd>alt</kbd>.
  Similarly, if we are going to move forward by 5 expressions,
  then <code>C-M-5 C-M-f</code> is going to be more convenient than
  using any other modifier for the digit argument.
</p>
<p>
  Choosing the modifier combination for a universal argument such that
  it matches the modifier combination for the key sequence coming up
  next helps maintain good <em>tempo</em> while typing the key
  sequences.  The book often puts emphasis on the subject of tempo in
  various chapters.
</p>
<p>
  While discussing tempo, the book presents the example of <code>M--
  M-d</code> which can be used to kill the previous word.  Note
  that <code>M-d</code> kills one word forward, so <code>M--
  M-d</code> reverses the direction of the operation and kills one
  word backward.  The book notes that <code>M-- M-d</code> maintains
  tempo while <code>C-- M-d</code> which does exactly the same thing
  disrupts tempo.
</p>
<p>
  Another example that the section <em>Univeral Arguments</em> briefly
  alludes to but does not provide a concrete example of is changing
  the case of a word that we just typed.  Here are some concrete
  examples for it:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>M-l</code>: Convert the text from the point to the end of
    the current or next word to lower case.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>M-u</code>: Convert the text from the point to the end of
    the current or next word to upper case.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>M-c</code>: Capitalise the text from the point to the end of
    the current or next word.  Capitalisation involves changing only
    the first letter to upper case.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>M- M-l</code>: Convert the text from the point to the
    beginning of the current or previous word to upper case.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>M- M-u</code>: Convert the text from the point to the
    beginning of the current or previous word to upper case.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>M- M-c</code>: Capitalise the text from the point to the
    beginning of the current or previous word.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="discovering-and-remembering-keys">Discovering and Remembering Keys</h2>
<p>
  To get help for a prefix key, type the prefix key followed
  by <code>C-h</code>.  Here are some examples:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>C-x C-h</code></li>
  <li><code>C-x 8 C-h</code></li>
  <li><code>C-x 8 " C-h</code></li>
  <li><code>C-x 8 ' C-h</code></li>
  <li><code>C-x 8 * C-h</code></li>
</ul>
<p>
  Getting help for a prefix key in this manner shows an automatically
  generated list of all keys that belong to the key map associated
  with the prefix key.  Note that a key map for a prefix key may
  itself contain more prefix keys.  For example, in the above
  examples, we see that the key map for <code>C-x 8</code> contains
  prefix keys <code>C-x 8 "</code>, <code>C-x 8 '</code>, etc.  Such
  nested prefix keys are clearly marked in the output as "Prefix
  Command".
</p>
<h2 id="true-colour">True Colour</h2>
<p>
  There is a note with the title <em>Supported colors</em> in the
  section <em>The Customize Interface</em> that introduces the
  following commands:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>M-x list-color-display RET</code>: Display names of defined
    colours and show what they look like.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>M-x info-apropos RET Colors on a TTY RET</code>: Find an
    info page on the subject of using colours on a TTY.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Since Emacs 28, we can easily enable 24-bit colour in terminal Emacs
  by setting the environment variable
  <code>COLORTERM=truecolor</code>.  To quickly test it out,
  first enter the following command in the terminal:
</p>
<pre><code>COLORTERM=truecolor emacs -nw</code></pre>
<p>
  Then type the following in Emacs:
</p>
<pre><code>M-x list-color-display RET</code></pre>
<h2 id="the-customise-interface">The Customise Interface</h2>
<p>
  The customise interface allows us to customise two things: faces and
  options.  Here are some steps to get started with the customise
  interface:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Type <code>C-x 2</code> to split the current window into two.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Type <code>C-x C-f foo.el RET</code> to open a new Elisp file.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Type some code into the file such that it contains at least one
      string, for example:
    </p>
    <pre><code>(message "hello")</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Type <code>C-x o</code> to go to the other window.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Type <code>M-x customize RET</code>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Move the cursor to the editable text area.  This can be done
      with motion key sequences or with the mouse.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Then type <code>font-lock-string-face</code> and
      press <kbd>enter</kbd>.  The customisation interface for the
      chosen face now appears in the buffer.  The message next to the
      "State" button shows "STANDARD." which indicates that the face
      is set to its default value.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Then move the cursor to the editable text area next to the
      "Foreground:" label, type <code>blue</code>.  At this point, a
      preview of blue text is shown next to the "Choose" button.
      However, the string in the Elisp buffer still appears in its
      previous colour.  The message next to the "State" button shows
      "EDITED, shown value does not take effect until you set or save
      it."
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Now click the "Apply" button to apply the new string colour.
      Alternatively, move the cursor over to "Apply" and
      press <kbd>enter</kbd>.  As soon as this button is clicked, the
      string in the Elisp buffer appears blue.  The message next to
      the "State" button says "Set for current session only."
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Now click the "Revert..." button and then click
      "Revert This Session's Customizations" to revert the customisation.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Now change the string colour to blue again and click "Apply and
      Save".  The message next to the "State" button now changes to
      "SAVED and set."  Then check Emacs initialisation file (such
      as <code>~/.emacs</code>, <code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code>, etc.)
      and there should be a <code>custom-set-faces</code> call added
      to the initialisation file to set the string colour to blue.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      To erase the customisation from the initialisation file, click
      "Revert ..." and then click "Erase Customizations".  At this
      point, the customisation is no longer present in the
      initialisation file.  However, the customise interface shows a
      confusing message next to the "State" button, "EDITED, shown
      value does not take effect until you set or save it."  Further,
      the face is set to "-- Empty face --" in the customisation
      interface.  To add to the confusion, the "Apply and Save" button
      is enabled!  Beware though!  If "Apply and Save" is clicked now,
      it will set <code>nil</code> as the value for the face which
      will cause the face to appear black or white (not the default
      colour).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      To get rid of the confusing state of the customisation buffer
      discussed in the previous point and restore the customisation
      buffer to a sane state, click "Revert ..." and then click either
      "Undo Edits in Customization Buffer" or click
      "Revert This Session's Customizations".  Doing so would end up
      showing the default colour of the face in the customise
      interface.  The message next to the "State" button shows
      "STANDARD." again.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="customise-commands">Customise Commands</h2>
<p>
  Here are some examples of complete key sequences that invoke various
  customise commands:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>M-x customize RET</code>: Display customise interface.  We
    can reach a specific item to be customised by navigating the
    groups presented and the subgroups within them.  For example, to
    customise <code>font-lock-string-face</code>, we can naviage to
    Faces &gt; Font Lock &gt; Font Lock Faces &gt; Font Lock String
    Face.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>M-x customize-browse RET</code>: Create a tree browser for
    the customise hierarchy.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>M-x customize-option RET global-display-line-numbers
    RET</code>: Customise a specific option.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>M-x customize-face RET font-lock-string-face RET</code>:
    Customise a specific face.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>M-x customize-group RET faces RET</code>: Customise a
    specific group.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>M-x customize-group RET font-lock-faces RET</code>: Another
    example similar to the previous one.  This one customises
    the <em>Font Lock Faces</em> subgroup within the <em>Faces</em>
    group.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>M-x customize-mode RET</code>: Customise the major mode of
    the current buffer.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>M-x customize-mode RET python-mode RET</code>: Customise a
    specific mode.  After the first <code>RET</code>, a prompt to
    enter the mode appears only if the current major mode has no known
    customise group.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>C-u M-x customize-mode RET python-mode RET</code>: Yet
    another way to customise a specific mode.  Using the prefix
    argument ensures that we are always prompted for the mode name.
    This can be useful when we want to customise a minor mode or a
    major mode that is different from the current major mode.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>M-x customize-themes RET</code>: Display a selectable list
    of custom themes.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>M-x customize-customized RET</code>: Customise all
    customisations set in the session but not saved.  This is very
    useful to see all unsaved customisations together at one place.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>M-x customize-saved RET</code>: Customise all saved
    customisations.  This is very useful to see all saved
    customisations together at one place.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>M-x customize-changed RET</code>: Customise all settings
    whose meanings have changed since the previous major Emacs
    release.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>M-x customize-changed RET 26.1 RET</code>: Customise all
    settings whose meanings have changed since a particular previous
    major Emacs release.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  One thing worth keeping in mind is that when we apply, save or
  revert customisations, only the customisations shown in the current
  buffer are applied, saved or reverted.  Here is an experiment that
  demonstrates what this means:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Type <code>C-x 2</code> followed by <code>C-x C-f foo.el
      RET</code> to split the current window into two and load an
      Elisp file in one window.  Then insert the following code:
    </p>
    <pre><code>(defun foo () (message "hello")) ;; Demo</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Type <code>M-x customize RET</code>, search
      for <code>font-lock-keyword-face</code>, set its colour
      to <code>red</code> and click "Apply".
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Then search for <code>font-lock-function-name-face</code>, set
      its colour to <code>green</code> and click "Apply".  At this
      point the macro name <code>defun</code> is coloured red and the
      function name <code>foo</code> is coloured green in the Elisp
      buffer.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Now click "Revert ..." and then click
      "Revert This Session's Customizations".  Only the colour of the
      function name reverts to the default colour.  The colour of the
      macro name remains red in the Elisp buffer.  This confirms that
      the revert operation takes only the customisations in the buffer
      into account.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Search for <code>font-lock-string-face</code>, set its colour
      to <code>blue</code> and click "Apply and Save".
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Search for <code>font-lock-comment-face</code>, set its colour
      to <code>magenta</code> and click "Apply and Save".  Inspecting
      the Emacs initialisation file shows that only the customisations
      for the string and comment faces have been saved to the file.
      This confirms that only the customisations shown in the current
      buffer are saved.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Type <code>M-x customize-customized RET</code>.  A new buffer
      appears and shows the customisation for keyword because it was
      customised and applied but not saved.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Type <code>M-x customize-saved RET</code>.  A new buffer appears
      and shows the customisations for string and comment because they
      were customised and saved.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Now search for <code>font-lock-comment-face</code> so that the
      customise buffer contains only the customisation entry for
      comment.  Click "Revert ..." and then click
      "Erase Customizations".  Inspecting the Emacs initialisation
      file shows that the customisation for comment is removed but the
      customisation for string is still intact.  This confirms that
      only the customisation shown in the current buffer is erased.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="evaluating-elisp-code">Evaluating Elisp Code</h2>
<p>
  The chapter introduces two commands:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>M-x eval-buffer RET</code>: Evaluate the entire buffer.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>M-x eval-region RET</code>: Evaluates only the marked
    region.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Here are some additional key sequences that I find very useful:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>C-x C-e</code>: Evaluate the expression before the cursor.
    This key binding is available in <code>global-map</code>, so this
    key sequence works in any buffer.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>C-M-x</code>: Evaluate the top-level expression on the
    cursor.  This key binding is not available in the global map.
    Therefore this key sequence works only in those major modes that
    support it.  For example, this key sequence works in Elisp buffers
    because this key binding is available
    in <code>emacs-lisp-mode-map</code>.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="info">Info</h2>
<p>
  <em>Info</em>, also known as the <em>Info Reader</em>, is the
  documentation browser of Emacs.  Type
  <code>M-x info RET</code> or <code>C-h i</code> to enter
  Info.
</p>
<p>
  The following points explain the navigation commands of Info:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Type <code>[</code> or <code>]</code> to go to the previous or
    next node, respectively.  Typing <code>]</code> repeatedly is a
    nice way to go from one node to the next one without skipping any
    content.  This provides an experience that very close to reading a
    book page by page although <code>SPC</code> (explained below)
    might be an even better way.
  </li>
  <li>
    Type <code>l</code> or <code>r</code> to go back or forward in
    history, respectively.
  </li>
  <li>
    Type <code>n</code> or <code>p</code> to go to the previous or
    next sibling node.  This is a nice way to go from one chapter to
    next while skipping all the child nodes or to go from one section
    to the next sibling section while skipping all child subsections.
  </li>
  <li>
    Type <code>u</code> to go up one level to the parent node.
  </li>
  <li>
    Type <code>SPC</code> to scroll one screen forward at a time.
    Type <code>DEL</code> or <code>S-SPC</code> to scroll one screen
    backward at a time.  When a node boundary is reached, these
    commands automatically load the next or previous node.  Thus
    typing <code>SPC</code> over and over again is a nice way to read
    all the text in a node and then go to the next node.  This
    provides an experience that is closest to reading a book paragraph
    by paragraph and page by page.
  </li>
  <li>
    Type <code>TAB</code> to go to the next cross-reference or menu
    item, i.e., anything that looks like a link.
    Type <code>S-TAB</code> or <code>C-M-i</code> to go back to the
    previous cross-reference or menu item.
  </li>
  <li>
    Type <code>RET</code> to follow a node reference near point.  This
    behaves like visiting a link.
  </li>
  <li>
    Type <code>m</code> to prompt for a menu item to go to.  The menu
    item near the point is automatically selected as the default
    answer to the prompt.
  </li>
  <li>
    Type <code>q</code> to quit Info.  The Info buffer is not killed.
    Therefore typing <code>C-h i</code> will switch to the Info buffer
    and we can read the last node we visited again.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  To summarise, the commands <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> are
  great for browsing every node.  The command <code>SPC</code>
  and <code>DEL</code> are good for reading everything paragraph by
  paragraph and page by page.
</p>
<p>
  There are several ways to reach a specific node of a specific
  manual.  The following points describe some of them:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    When we open the Info reader with <code>C-h i</code> for the first
    time, immediately typing <code>m</code> is a convenient way to
    enter a particular menu item for a manual and jump to that manual,
    e.g., type <code>C-h i m org RET</code> to go to the Org manual.
  </li>
  <li>
    Since Emacs 28, we can also use <code>C-h R</code> to open a
    specific manual from any buffer, i.e., we do not need to
    type <code>C-h i</code> first to enter Info.  For example,
    type <code>C-h R org RET</code> to enter the Org manual.
  </li>
  <li>
    To look up the documentation for a command, type <code>C-h
      F</code>, e.g., <code>C-h F find-file RET</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Although not mentioned in the book, a popular way to point others
    to a specific node in the manual is to provide an Elisp expression
    to visit a node.  For example, to read the node
    named <code>Internal Links</code> in the <code>org</code> manual,
    evaluate the expression <code>(info "(org)Internal Links")</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    An alternative to the Elisp expression in the previous point could
    be typing <code>C-h R org RET m Hyperlinks RET m Internal Links
    RET</code> or even <code>C-h R org RET m Internal Links
    RET</code>.  However, the Elisp expression in the previous point
    is a convenient way to share a pointer to a specific node in a
    specific manual with other Emacs users.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="apropos">Apropos</h2>
<p>
  The following key sequences demonstrate how to use the apropos
  system:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>C-h a ^whitespace RET</code>: Find all commands that match
    the regular expression pattern <code>^whitespace</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>M-x apropos-command RET ^whitespace RET</code>: Same as
    above.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>M-x apropos RET ^whitespace RET</code>: Show all symbols
    that match the given regular expression pattern.  The matches
    include symbols defined as functions, variables and faces.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>C-h d cleanup-region RET</code>: Show symbols whose
    documentation strings match the given regular expression pattern.
    Note that this command shows symbols
    like <code>whitespace-cleanup</code>
    and <code>whitespace-report-region</code> in the results because
    their documentation strings contain the
    string <code>"cleanup-region"</code>.  However, it does not show
    the symbol <code>whitespace-cleanup-region</code> because its
    documentation string does not contain this string.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>M-x apropos-documentation RET cleanup-region RET</code>:
    Same as above.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>M-x apropos-library RET whitespace RET</code>: Show all
    variables and functions defined by the library
    <code>whitespace</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>M-x apropos-user-option RET ^whitespace RET</code>: Show
    user options that match the given pattern.  This includes
    variables that can be customised in the customise interface.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>M-x apropos-value RET ^[^ ]*text RET</code>: Show all
    symbols which have values whose printed representation matches the
    given pattern.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  By default, the apropos commands show the results in alphabetical
  order.  To sort them by scores, evaluate the following Elisp
  expression:
</p>
<pre><code>(setq apropos-sort-by-scores t)</code></pre>
<p>
  To sort the matches by score as well as show the scores within
  parentheses next to the matches, evaluate the following Elisp
  expression:
</p>
<pre><code>(setq apropos-sort-by-scores 'verbose)</code></pre>
<p>
  Note that sorting by score does not work for <code>C-h d</code>
  (<code>apropos-documentation</code>).
</p>
<h2 id="describe">Describe</h2>
<p>
  The following key sequences demonstrate the describe system:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>C-h m</code>: Display documentation of current major mode
    and minor modes along with key bindings introduced by the modes.
    Mode-specific commands that are not bound to any key are not
    shown.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>C-h x calc RET</code>: Display documentation of
    the <code>calc</code> command.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>C-h f calc RET</code>: Same as above.  However, note that
    while <code>C-h f</code> can display documentation of any
    function, <code>C-h x</code> on the other hand can display
    documentation of only those functions that are also commands.  For
    example, <code>C-h f string-join RET</code> works fine
    but <code>C-h x string-join RET</code> complains about no match.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>C-h v tab-width RET</code>: Display documentation of the
    variable <code>tab-width</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>C-h k C-x C-f</code>: Display documentation of the command
    bound to the key sequence <code>C-x C-f</code>.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>

  The following list includes some links that were discussed during
  the book discussion group meetings:
