  The following notes were taken while discussing Chapter 2 of the
  book <em>Mastering Emacs,</em> 2022 edition (written by Mickey
  Petersen) in
  <a href="./{{ index }}">book discussion group meetings</a>.

<p>
  The following commands mentioned in the book invoke some interesting
  functions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>M-x zone RET</code>: Zone out, completely; a built-in screensaver.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>M-x dunnet RET</code>: Dungeon text adventure game.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>M-x tetris RET</code>: Tetris clone.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>M-x lunar-phases RET</code>: Lunar phases calendar.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>M-x doctor RET</code>: ELIZA chatterbot.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cornerstore-of-emacs">Cornerstone of Emacs</h2>
<p>
  The chapter mentions the Elisp interpreter as the cornerstone of
  Emacs.  In fact, Emacs is an editor program that runs in the Elisp
  interpreter.  When we start Emacs, what really starts first is an
  Elisp interpreter.  It executes the Elisp code of an editor program.
  When that program executes, we get Emacs, the editor!
</p>
<p>
  This behaviour is quite the opposite of how Vim and other editors
  behave.  For example, when we start Vim or Visual Studio Code, first
  the editor runs.  The editor then provides an embedded programming
  language that we can use to write plugins and extend the editor.
  For example, Vim offers VimScript to let us write code using
  VimScript and extend the functionality of Vim.  However, when we
  start Emacs, first the Elisp interpreter runs and this interpreter
  executes a program that results in Emacs, the editor.
</p>
<h2 id="uptime">Uptime</h2>
<p>
  The key sequence <code>M-x emacs-uptime RET</code> shows how long
  the current instance of Emacs has been running.  Many users have
  month-long uptimes.
</p>
<h2 id="rpn-calculator">RPN Calculator</h2>
<p>
  To try out the calculator, type <code>C-x * c</code> or <code>M-x
  calc RET</code> to start the calculator.  Then to calculate
  something like, say, 1 + (2 * 3), type <code>1 RET 2 RET 3 RET *
  +</code>.
</p>
<h2 id="point-and-mark">Point and Mark</h2>
<p>
  To try out point and mark quickly, first open a buffer with some
  text in it.  For example, open a file, say, <code>foo.txt</code>
  using the key sequence <code>C-x C-f foo.txt RET</code>.  Make sure
  there are a few lines of text in the buffer.  If it is a new buffer,
  type some lines of text into it.  Then move the point (cursor) to
  any arbitrary place within the text.  The motion keys
  like <code>C-p</code>, <code>C-n</code>, <code>C-b</code>, <code>C-f</code>,
  etc. or simply <code>&lt;up&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;down&gt;</code>,
  <code>&lt;left&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;right&gt;</code>, etc. may be
  used to do this.
</p>
<p>
  Then type <code>C-SPC</code>
  (i.e., <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>space</kbd>) to set the mark at the
  current position of the point.  Then move the point around.  Emacs
  should now be highlighting the region between the mark (set earlier)
  and the point.  Then type <code>M-w</code>
  (i.e., <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>w</kbd>) to copy the text in the selected
  region or type <code>C-w</code> to cut the text instead.  Finally,
  move the point around again and type <code>C-y</code> to paste the
  copied/cut text.
</p>
<h2 id="returning-to-mark">Returning to Mark</h2>
<p>
  Marks can also be used to remember a position in the buffer to which
  we may wish to return to later.  To try it out, first move the point
  to some place in the buffer where a mark needs to be set.  Then
  type <code>C-SPC C-SPC</code> to set the mark without activating it
  (activating a mark causes Emacs to highlight the region as explained
  in the previous section).  Then move the point to some other place
  in the buffer.  Finally, type <code>C-u C-SPC</code> to return to
  the marked position.
</p>
<h2 id="font-locking">Font Locking</h2>
<p>
  Font locking (syntax highlighting) in Emacs is made up of faces of
  properties (colour, font, size, etc.).  Type <code>C-u C-x =</code>
  to describe the current character (the character the cursor is on).
  The output displays the face details as well.  Alternatively,
  type <code>M-x describe-face RET</code> to describe the face of the
  character the cursor is on.
</p>
<h2 id="change-major-mode">Change Major Mode</h2>
<p>
  Emacs almost always sets the appropriate major mode by inspecting
  the filename or the content of the buffer.  However, sometimes it
  can be useful to set the major mode manually.  For example, consider
  a file named <code>foo.html</code> which is open in Emacs and has
  the following text:
</p>
<pre>
<code>&lt;h1&gt;Euler's Identity&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  In mathematics, &lt;em&gt;Euler's identity&lt;/em&gt; is the
  equality

  \[
    e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0.
  \]

  Euler's identity is a special case of Euler's formula from complex
  analysis, which states that for any real number \( x, \)

  \[
    e^{ix} = \cos x + i \sin x.
  \]
&lt;/p&gt;</code>
</pre>
<p>
  This is an HTML file with some LaTeX snippets that would perhaps be
  rendered using a LaTeX rendering tool such as MathJax or KaTeX.  By
  default, when this file is opened in Emacs, the major mode is set to
  HTML+.  However, if one wants to focus on editing the embedded LaTeX
  content, it is possible to change the major mode to LaTeX by
  typing <code>M-x latex-mode RET</code>.  To change the major mode
  back to HTML+, type <code>M-x mhtml-mode RET</code>.
