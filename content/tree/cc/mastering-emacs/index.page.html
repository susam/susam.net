  or <a href="https://web.libera.chat/#susam">#susam:libera.chat</a>

</p>
<p>
  <small>&ddagger; You only need to join either the Matrix channel or
  the Libera channel, not both.  Both channels are bridged together.
  If you are not an active IRC user, prefer joining the Matrix channel
  because it is more convenient for someone unfamiliar with IRC.  For
  example, you can close your browser or client and your chat session
  will still stay alive on Matrix.  You can connect back the next day
  and catch up with the messages.  Doing that with IRC requires
  slightly more work such as setting up IRC bouncers etc.</small>
</p>
<p>
  The primary reference book for these meetings is
  <em>Mastering Emacs</em> written by Mickey Petersen (2022 edition).
  PDF and EPUB copies of this book can be purchased
  from <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/">masteringemacs.org</a>.

  These recordings are deleted automatically after 7 days.

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <h3 id="what-is-this-club-about">What is this club about?</h3>
    <p>
      This is a hobby club with a focus on mathematics and
      computation.  This club picks reading material about concepts
      and technologies that have been around for a long time and have
      an air of timelessness around them.  See the blog
      post <a href="../../reading-classic-computation-books.html">Reading
      Classic Computation Books</a> for more details.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="who-runs-this-club">Who runs this club?</h3>
    <p>
      My name is Susam.  This is my website.  I run this club.  I host
      the book club meetings.  The last series of book club meetings I
      hosted was about <a href="../iant/{{ index }}">analytic number
      theory</a>.  Some members of Libera IRC network and Hacker News
      participated in those meetings.  This new series is going to be
      about Emacs.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="what-is-planned">What is planned for the next few meetings?</h3>
    <p>
      See the <a href="log.html">meeting log</a> which contains a
      rough plan for the next few meetings along with an archive of
      all previous meetings.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="do-i-need-to-read-in-advance">Do I need to read the planned chapters/pages in advance before coming to the meetings?</h3>
    <p>
      Not at all.  It is up to you, really.  If you would like to read
      the chapters in advance and come, that's great.  But it is not
      necessary.  We are going to discuss every page of the book in
      detail anyway.  Further, we will demonstrate the concepts we
      learn from the book live using an actual Emacs editor.  So it is
      perfectly fine if you want to join the meetings without any
      preparation.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="can-beginners-join">I have little to no knowledge of Emacs.  Can I join?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, certainly!  The reference book selected for these meetings
      teaches Emacs from scratch.  No prior knowledge is expected from
      the participants of these meeetings.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="can-experts-join">I am an expert in Emacs.  Will the meetings be useful to me?</h3>
    <p>
      In online discussions, often people with many years of Emacs
      experience have claimed that despite their high degree of
      expertise in Emacs, the book taught them new stuff.  Whether
      attending 40-minute meetings, a few days a week, with a
      possibility of learning something new is a good return of your
      investment or not, is something you might want to consider.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having said that, expert Emacs users and developers are very
      welcome to these meetings.  In the previous meetings on analytic
      number theory, we found that the experts often contributed to
      the meetings with new insights and interesting background
      information that helped everyone learn the reading material
      better.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="can-i-lurk">Can I just lurk in the meetings?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes!  Lurking is absolutely fine in our club meetings.  In fact,
      most members of the club join in and stay silent throughout the
      meetings.  Only a few members talk via audio/video or chat.
      This is considered absolutely normal in this club, so please do
      not hesitate to join our meetings!
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="vim-or-emacs">Tell me honestly.  Which is better?  Vim or Emacs?</h3>
    <p>
      Sorry, we don't do this here!  <!-- Emacs!  Definitely Emacs!  -->
    </p>
  <li>
    <h3 id="where-can-i-ask-questions">I have more questions.  Where can I ask?</h3>
    <p>
      Join the club channel
      at <a href="https://app.element.io/#/room/#susam:matrix.org">#susam:matrix.org</a>
      or <a href="https://web.libera.chat/#susam">#susam:libera.chat</a>
      to ask more questions.
