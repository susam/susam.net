  The following complete key sequences illustrate a few basic
  commands:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>C-x C-f foo.txt RET</code>: Edit file
    named <code>foo.txt</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>C-x C-s</code>: Save current buffer to file.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>C-x b *scratch* RET</code>: Switch to the buffer
    named <code>*scratch*</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>C-x k *scratch* RET</code>: Kill the buffer
    named <code>*scratch*</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>C-x k RET</code>: Kill current buffer.  In fact, like the
    previous key sequence above, typing <code>C-x k</code> first
    prompts for the buffer name.  However, the current buffer name is
    selected as the default value already.  As a result,
    typing <code>RET</code> kills the current buffer.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>C-x C-b</code>: List buffers.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>C-x C-c</code>: Exit Emacs.  This command offers to save all
    unsaved buffers before exiting Emacs.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>ESC ESC ESC</code>: This command exits the current context.
    What that means depends very much on the context.  It performs
    exactly one of the following actions: If there is an active
    region, then it is deactivated; if a minibuffer is open, it gets
    rid of it; if recursive edit is in progress, it quits one level of
    recursive editing; if multiple windows are open, it deletes other
    windows so that the current window becomes the only window in the
    frame.  The aforementioned conditions are tested one by one and as
    soon as one of the conditions is met, the corresponding action is
    executed and the other conditions are skipped.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>C-/</code>: Undo changes.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>F10</code>: Activate the menu bar.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  In my experience, I have found that <code>ESC ESC ESC</code> is most
  useful when a stray minibuffer is open but the cursor is on some
  other buffer instead of the minibuffer and I need to close the
  minibuffer.  Here are some steps that demonstrate this usage:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Type <code>M-x white</code> and pause.  We now have a partially
      typed command in the minibuffer.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Now pretend that we get distracted by some imperfections in the
      text buffer that was open earlier and we want to fix those
      first.  Type <code>C-x o</code> to move away from the minibuffer
      and go back to the text buffer to perform some editing tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this step, we could have typed <code>C-g</code> to quit the
      minibuffer first but we did not do that.  We pretended to get
      distracted by the text buffer and went straight to it from the
      minibuffer by typing <code>C-x o</code>.  At this point, the
      cursor is in the text buffer and the minibuffer remains open at
      the bottom.  The open minibuffer can be distracting while
      performing the text editing tasks.  Typing <code>C-g</code> now
      will not get rid of the minibuffer because the cursor is no
      longer in the minibuffer.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Now one way to close the open minibuffer could be to
      type <code>C-x o</code> to go back to the minibuffer window and
      type <code>C-g</code>.  However, there is a more direct way to
      do this as explained in the next point.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Type <code>ESC ESC ESC</code> to get rid of the minibuffer at
      the bottom.  This works even when the cursor is not in the
      minibuffer but is in the text buffer instead.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="major-mode-load-order">Major Mode Load Order</h2>
<p>
  The chapter mentions the following order for detecting major mode:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>File-local variables</li>
  <li>Program loader directives</li>
  <li>Magic mode detection</li>
  <li>Automatic mode detection</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Let us start from the bottom of the list and share some experimental
  results that illustrate how the major mode detection works.
</p>
<h3 id="file-local-variables">File-Local Variables</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Create a text file named <code>foo.txt</code> with the following
      content:
    </p>
    <pre>
<code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main() {
  std::cout << "hello, world\n";
  return 0;
}</code>
</pre>
    <p>
      Then open this file in Emacs (say, with <code>C-x C-f foo.txt
      RET</code>).  Emacs sets the major mode to <code>Text</code>
      (i.e., <code>text-mode</code>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Type <code>M-: major-mode RET</code> to confirm that indeed the
      value of <code>major-mode</code> is <code>text-mode</code>.
      This happens due to automatic mode detection which determines
      the major mode based on the file name.  In this case it sees
      that the file name ends with <code>.txt</code> and
      enables <code>text-mode</code>.  We will discuss automatic mode
      detection further in the
      section <a href="#automatic-mode-detection">Automatic Mode
      Detection</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Now edit the previous file to add file-local variables in the
      header as follows:
    </p>
    <pre>
<code>// -*- mode: c++; c-basic-offset: 4 -*-

#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main() {
  std::cout << "hello, world\n";
  return 0;
}</code>
</pre>
    <p>
      Now reload the buffer.  You could simply kill the buffer
      with <code>C-x k</code> and reopen the file with <code>C-x C-f
      foo.txt RET</code> or alternatively, reload the buffer
      with <code>M-x revert-buffer RET yes RET</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      After reloading the buffer, you should see that
      the <code>C++</code> mode (i.e., <code>c++-mode</code>) is
      enabled.  As a result, C++ syntax highlighting should be
      visible.  Further <code>C-x h TAB</code> should reformat the
      code to use 4 spaces for each level of indentation.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      File-local variables may be specified in the footer too as shown
      below:
    </p>
    <pre>
<code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main() {
    std::cout << "hello, world\n";
    return 0;
}

// Local Variables:
// mode: c++
// c-basic-offset: 6
// End:</code>
</pre>
    <p>
      Now reloading the buffer should show that <code>c++-mode</code>
      is enabled and typing <code>C-x h TAB</code> should reformat the
      code to use 6 spaces for each level of indentation.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      What happens if the file-local variables in the header and
      footer contradict each other?  To test this out, edit the buffer
      to have the following content:
    </p>
    <pre>
<code>// -*- mode: c++; c-basic-offset: 4 -*-

#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main() {
      std::cout << "hello, world\n";
      return 0;
}

// Local Variables:
// mode: python
// c-basic-offset: 6
// End:</code>
</pre>
    <p>
      Reloading the buffer should show that <code>c++-mode</code> is
      active.  Typing <code>C-x h TAB</code> should reformat the code
      to use 6 spaces for each level of indentation.  Therefore the
      mode specified in the header remains effective.  For other
      variables, the ones specified in the footer have precedence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, the example above is intended for curiosity and
      exploration.  In practical use, however, it is best to avoid
      assigning conflicting values to file-local variables in both the
      header and footer.  Such inconsistencies can lead to confusion
      and make the effect of the variables difficult to understand.
