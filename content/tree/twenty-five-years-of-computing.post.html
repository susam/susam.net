  Last year, I completed 20 years in professional software
  development.  I wanted to write a post to mark the occasion back
  then, but couldn't find the time.  This post is my attempt to make
  up for that omission.  In fact, I have been involved in software
  development for slightly longer than 20 years.  Although I had
  my <a href="fd-100.html">first taste of computer programming</a> as
  a child, it was only when I entered university about 25 years ago
  that I seriously got into software development.  So I'll start my
  stories from there.  These stories are less about software and more
  about people.  Unlike many career anniversary posts, this one
  contains no grand wisdom or lessons.  Just a collection of stories.
  I hope you'll enjoy at least a few of them.
</p>
{{ toc }}
<h2 id="my-first-lesson-in-html">My First Lesson in HTML</h2>
<p>
  The first story takes place in 2001, shortly after I joined
  university.  One evening, I went to the university computer
  laboratory to browse the web.  Out of curiosity, I typed
  <code>susam.com</code> into the address bar to see what kind of
  website existed there.  I ended up on this home page:
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010721163153/http://susam.com/">susam.com</a>.
  It looked much larger back then because display resolutions were
  lower, so the text and banner covered almost half the screen.  I was
  simply trying to make sense of the Internet.  I remember wondering
  what it would take to create my own website, perhaps
  at <code>susam.com</code>.  That's when an older student who had
  been watching me browse over my shoulder approached and asked
  whether that was my name and if I had created the website.  I told
  him I hadn't and that I had no idea how websites were made.  He
  asked me to move aside, took my seat and clicked View &gt; Source in
  Internet Explorer.  He then explained how websites are made of HTML
  pages and how those pages are simply text instructions.
</p>
<p>
  Next, he opened Notepad and wrote a simple HTML page containing
  nothing but a <code>&lt;BODY&gt;</code> tag with 'HELLO' inside it,
  then showed me how it appeared in the browser.  He demonstrated a
  few more things as well, such as using the <code>&lt;FONT&gt;</code>
  tag to change colour, typeface and size.  It was only a brief
  ten-minute tutorial, but it made the World Wide Web feel much less
  mysterious and far more fascinating.
</p>
<p>
  That person had an ulterior motive though.  After the tutorial, he
  never gave the seat back to me.  He simply continued browsing and
  waited for me to leave.  I was too timid to ask for my seat back.
  Seats were limited, so I returned to my dorm room both disappointed
  that I couldn't continue browsing that day and excited about all the
  websites I might create with this newfound knowledge.  I could never
  register <code>susam.com</code> for myself though.  That domain was
  always used by some business selling Turkish cuisines.  Eventually,
  I managed to get the next best thing: a <code>.net</code> domain of
  my own.  That brief encounter in the university laboratory set me on
  a lifelong path of creating and maintaining personal websites.
</p>
<h2 id="reset-vector">The Reset Vector</h2>
<p>
  <p>
  The second story also comes from my university days.  I was hanging
  out with my mates in the computer laboratory.  In front of me was
  MS-DOS running on a machine with an Intel 8086 processor.  I think I
  was working on a lift control program when my mind drifted to a
  small detail about the 8086 microprocessor that we had recently
  learnt in a lecture.  Our professor had explained that when the 8086
  is reset, execution begins with CS:IP set to FFFF:0000.  So I
  murmured to anyone who cared to listen, 'I wonder if the system will
  reboot if I jump to FFFF:0000.'  I then opened
  <code>DEBUG.EXE</code> and jumped to that address.
</p>
<pre><samp>C:\&gt;<kbd>DEBUG</kbd>
<kbd>G =FFFF:0000</kbd></samp></pre>
<p>
  The machine rebooted instantly.  One of my friends, who topped the
  class every semester, had been watching over my shoulder.  As soon
  as the machine restarted, he exclaimed, 'How did you do that?'  I
  explained that the reset vector is located at physical address
  <code>FFFF0</code>, and that the CS:IP value
  <code>FFFF:0000</code> maps to that address in real mode.  After
  that, I simply went back to working on my lift control program and
  didn't think much more about the incident.
</p>
<p>
  About a week later, the same friend came to my dorm room.  He sat
  down with a very serious expression and asked, 'How did you know to
  do that?  How did it occur to you to jump to the reset vector?'  I
  must have said something like, 'It just occurred to me.  I
  remembered that detail from the lecture and wanted to try it out.'
  He then said, 'I want to be able to think like that.  I come top of
  the class every year, but I don't think the way you do.  I would
  never have thought of taking a small detail like that and testing it
  myself.'  I replied that I was simply curious to see whether what we
  had learnt actually worked in practice.  He responded, 'And that's
  exactly it.  It would never occur to me to try something like that.
  I feel disappointed that I keep coming top of the class, yet I am
  not curious in the same way you are.  I've decided I don't want to
  top the class anymore.  I just want to explore and experiment with
  what we learn, the way you do.'
</p>
<p>
  That was all he said before getting up and heading back to his dorm
  room.  I didn't take it very seriously at the time.  I couldn't
  imagine why someone would willingly give up the accomplishment of
  coming first every year.  But I was wrong.  He never topped the
  class again.  He still ranked highly, often within the top ten, but
  he kept his promise of never finishing first again.  To this day, I
  remember the incident fondly.  I still feel a mix of embarrassment
  and pride at having inspired someone to step back academically in
  order to have more fun with learning.  Of course, there is no reason
  one cannot do both.  But in the end, that was his decision, not
  mine.
</p>
<h2 id="my-first-job">My First Job</h2>
<p>
  In my first job, I was assigned to work on the installer for a
  specific component of an e-banking product.  The installer was
  written in Python and was quite fragile.  During my first week on
  the project, I spent much of my time stabilising the installer and
  writing a user guide with step-by-step instructions on how to use
  it.  The result was well received and appreciated by both my seniors
  and management.  To my surprise, my user guide was praised more than
  my improvements to the installer.  While the first few weeks were
  enjoyable, I soon realised I would not find the work fulfilling for
  very long.  I wrote to management a few times to ask whether I could
  transfer to a team where I could work on something more substantial.
</p>
<p>
  My emails were initially met with resistance.  After several rounds
  of discussion, however, someone who had heard about my situation
  reached out and suggested a team whose manager might be interested
  in interviewing me.  The team was based in a different city.  I was
  young and willing to relocate wherever I could find good work, so I
  immediately agreed to the interview.
</p>
<p>
  This was in 2006, when video conferencing was not yet common.  On
  the day of the interview, the hiring manager called me on my desk
  phone.  He began by introducing the team, which called itself
  <em>Archie</em>, short for <em>architecture</em>.  The team developed
  and maintained the web framework and core architectural components
  on which the entire e-banking product was built.  The product had
  existed long before open source frameworks such as Spring or Django
  became popular, so features such as API routing, authentication and
  authorisation layers, cookie management and similar capabilities were
  all implemented in-house by this specialised team.  Because the
  software was used in banking environments, it also had to pass strict
  security testing and audits to minimise the risk of serious flaws.
</p>
<p>
  The interview began well.  He asked several questions related to
  software security, such as what SQL injection is and how it can be
  prevented or how one might design a web framework that mitigates
  cross-site scripting attacks.  He also asked programming questions,
  most of which I answered pretty well.  Towards the end, however, he
  asked how we could prevent MITM attacks.  I had never heard the
  term, so I admitted that I did not know what MITM meant.  He then
  asked, 'Man in the middle?' but I still had no idea what that meant
  or whether it was even a software engineering concept.  He replied,
  'Learn everything you can about PKI and MITM.  We need to build a
  digital signatures feature for one of our corporate banking
  products.  That's the first thing we'll work on.'
</p>
<p>
  Over the next few weeks, I studied RFCs and documentation related to
  public key infrastructure, public key cryptography standards and
  related topics.  At first, the material felt intimidating, but after
  spending time each evening reading whatever relevant literature I
  could find, things gradually began to make sense.  Concepts that
  initially seemed complex and overwhelming eventually felt intuitive
  and elegant.  I relocated to the new city a few weeks later and
  delivered the digital signatures feature about a month after joining
  the team.  We used the open source Bouncy Castle library to
  implement digital signatures, which became my first real interaction
  with the open source community.  After that I worked on other parts
  of the product too.  The most rewarding part was knowing that the
  code I was writing became part of a mature product used by hundreds
  of banks and millions of users.  It was especially satisfying to see
  the work pass security testing and audits and be considered ready
  for release.
</p>
<p>
  That was my first real engineering job.  My manager also turned out
  to be an excellent mentor.  Working with him helped me develop new
  skills and his encouragement gave me confidence that stayed with me
  for years.  Nearly two decades have passed since then, yet the
  product apparently still exists.  In fact, in my current phase of
  life I sometimes happen to use that product as a customer.
  Sometimes, I open the browser developer tools to view the page
  source and can still see traces of the HTML generated by code I
  wrote almost twenty years ago.
</p>
<h2 id="sphagetti-code">Sphagetti Code</h2>
<p>
  Around 2007 or 2008, I began working on a proof of concept for
  developing widgets for an OpenTV set-top box.  The work involved
  writing code in a heavily trimmed-down version of C.  One afternoon,
  while making good progress on a few widgets, I noticed that they
  would occasionally crash at random.  I tried tracking down the bugs,
  but I was finding it surprisingly difficult to understand my own
  code.  I had managed to produce some truly spaghetti-like code,
  complete with dubious pointer operations that were almost certainly
  responsible for the crashes, yet I could not pinpoint where exactly
  things were going wrong.
</p>
<p>
  Ours was a small team of four people, each working on an independent
  proof of concept.  The most senior person on the team acted as our
  lead and architect.  Later that afternoon, I showed him my progress
  and explained that I was still trying to hunt down the bugs causing
  the widgets to crash.  He asked whether he could look at the code.
  After going through it briefly and probably realising that it was a
  bit of a mess, he asked me to send him the code as a tarball, which
  I promptly did.
</p>
<p>
  He then went back to his desk to study the code.  I remember
  thinking, 'There is no way he is going to find the problem.  I have
  been debugging this for hours and even I barely understand what I
  have written.  This is the worst spaghetti code I have ever
  produced.'  With little hope of a quick solution, I went back to
  debugging on my own.
</p>
<p>
  Barely five minutes later, he came back to my desk and asked me to
  open a specific file.  He then showed me exactly where the pointer
  bug was.  It had taken him only a few minutes not only to read my
  tangled code but also to understand it well enough to identify the
  fault and point it out.  As soon as I fixed that line, the crashes
  disappeared.  I was genuinely in awe of his skill.
</p>
<p>
  I have always loved computing and programming, so I had assumed I
  was already fairly good at it.  That incident, however, made me
  realise how much further I still had to go before I could consider
  myself a good software developer.  I did improve significantly in
  the years that followed and today I am far better at managing
  software complexity than I was back then.
</p>
<h2 id="animated-television-widgets">Animated Television Widgets</h2>
<p>
  In another project from that period, we worked on another set-top
  box platform that supported Java Micro Edition (Java ME) for widget
  development.  One day, the same architect from the previous story
  asked whether I could add animations to the widgets.  I told him
  that it should be possible.  To make this story clearer, though, I
  need to explain how the different stakeholders in the project were
  organised.
</p>
<p>
  Our small team effectively played the role of the software vendor.
  The final product going to market would carry the brand of a major
  telecom carrier, offering direct-to-home (DTH) television services,
  with the set-top box being one of the products sold to customers.
  The set top box was manufactured by another company.  So the project
  was a partnership between three parties: our company as the software
  vendor, the telecom carrier and the set-top box manufacturer.  The
  telecom carrier wanted to know whether widgets could be animated on
  screen with smooth slide-in and slide-out effects.  That was why the
  architect approached me to ask whether it could be done, and I told
  him it should be possible.
</p>
<p>
  I then began working on animating the widgets.  Meanwhile, the
  architect and a few senior colleagues attended a business meeting with
  all the partners present.  During the meeting, he explained that we
  were evaluating whether widget animations could be supported.  The
  set-top box manufacturer immediately dismissed the idea, saying,
  'That's impossible.  Our set-top box does not support animation.'
  When the architect returned and shared this with us, I replied, 'I do
  not understand.  If I can draw a widget, I can animate it too.  All
  it takes is clearing the widget and redrawing it at slightly different
  positions repeatedly.  In fact, I already have a working version.'
  I then showed a demo of the animated widgets running on the emulator.
</p>
<p>
  The following week, the architect attended another partners' meeting
  where he shared updates about our animated widgets.  I was not
  personally present, so what follows is second-hand information
  passed on by those who were there.  I learnt that the set-top box
  company reacted angrily.  For some reason, they were unhappy that we
  had managed to achieve results using their set-top box and APIs that
  they had officially described as impossible.  They demanded that we
  stop work on animation immediately, arguing that our work could not
  be allowed to contradict their official position.  If I remember
  correctly, there were even suggestions of legal consequences.  At
  that point, the telecom carrier's representative intervened and
  bluntly told the set-top box representative to just shut up.  If the
  set top box guy was furious, the telecom guy was even more so, 'You
  guys told us animation was not possible and these people are showing
  that it is.  You manufacture the set-top box.  How can you not know
  what it is capable of?'
</p>
<p>
  Meanwhile, I continued working and completed my proof-of-concept
  implementation.  It worked very well in the emulator, but I did not
  yet have access to the actual hardware.  The device was still in the
  process of being shipped to us, so all my early proof-of-concepts
  ran on the emulator.  The following week, the architect planned to
  travel to the set-top box company's office to test my widgets on the
  real hardware.
</p>
<p>
  At the time, I was quite proud of having apparently proven the
  manufacturer wrong.  Here I was, an engineer in his twenties working
  on one of my first major projects, already demonstrating
  capabilities that even the hardware maker believed were impossible.
  But when the architect travelled to test the widgets on the actual
  device, a problem emerged.  What looked like buttery smooth
  animation on the emulator appeared noticeably choppy on a real
  television.  Over the next few weeks, I experimented with frame
  rates, buffering strategies and optimising the computation done in
  the the rendering loop.  Each week, the architect travelled for
  testing and returned with the same report: the animation was still
  choppy.  The modest embedded hardware simply could not keep up with
  the required computation and rendering.  In the end, the telecom
  carrier decided that no animation was better than poor animation and
  dropped the idea altogether.  So in the end, the set-top box
  developers turned out to be correct after all.
</p>
<h2 id="good-blessings">Good Blessings</h2>
<p>
  Back in 2009, after completing about a year at RSA Security, I began
  looking for work that felt more intellectually stimulating,
  especially projects involving mathematics and algorithms.  I spoke
  with a few senior leaders about this, but nothing materialised for
  some time.  Then one day, Dr Burt Kaliski, Chief Scientist at RSA
  Laboratories, asked to meet me to discuss my career aspirations.  I
  have written about this in more detail in another post here:
  <a href="good-blessings.html">Good Blessings</a>.  I will summarise
  what followed.
</p>
<p>
  Dr Kaliski met me and offered a few suggestions about the kinds of
  teams I might approach to find more interesting work.  I followed
  his advice and eventually joined a team that turned out to be an
  excellent fit.  I remained with that team for the next six years.
  During that time, I worked on parser generators, formal language
  specification and implementation, as well as indexing and querying
  components of a petabyte-scale database.  I learnt something new
  almost every day during those six years, and it remains one of the
  most enjoyable periods of my career.  I have especially fond
  memories of working on parser generators alongside remarkably
  skilled engineers from whom I learnt a lot.
</p>
<p>
  Years later, I reflected on how that brief meeting with Dr Kaliski
  had altered the trajectory of my career.  I realised I was not sure
  whether I had properly expressed my gratitude to him for the role he
  had played in shaping my path.  So I wrote to thank him and explain
  how much that single conversation had influenced my life.  A few
  days later, Dr Kaliski replied, saying he was glad to know that the
  steps I took afterwards had worked out well.  Before ending his
  message, he wrote this heart-warming note:
</p>
<blockquote>
  &lsquo;One of my goals is to be able to provide encouragement to
  others who are developing their careers, just as others have
  invested in mine, passing good blessings from one generation to
  another.&rsquo;
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-ctf-scoreboard">The CTF Scoreboard</h2>
<p>
  This story comes from 2019.  By then, I was no longer a
  twenty-something engineer just starting out.  I was now a
  middle-aged staff engineer with years of experience building both
  low-level networking systems and database systems.  Most of my work
  up to that point had been in C and C++.  I was now entering a new
  phase where I would be developing microservices professionally in
  languages such as Go and Python.  None of this was unfamiliar
  territory.  Like many people in this profession, computing has long
  been one of my favourite hobbies.  So although my professional work
  for the previous decade had focused on C and C++, I had plenty of
  hobby projects in other languages, including Python and Go.  I
  cannot even say that I missed working in C and C++.  After all, who
  wants to spend their days chasing memory bugs in core dumps when you
  could be building features and delivering real value to customers?
</p>
<p>
  In October 2019, during Cybersecurity Awareness Month, a Capture the
  Flag (CTF) event was organised at our office.  The contest featured
  all kinds of puzzles, ranging from SQL injection challenges to
  insecure cryptography problems.  Some challenges also involved
  reversing binaries and exploiting stack overflow vulnerabilities.
</p>
<p>
  I am usually rather intimidated by such contests.  The whole idea of
  competitive problem-solving under time pressure tends to make me
  nervous.  But one of my colleagues persuaded me to participate in
  the CTF.  And, somewhat to my surprise, I turned out to be rather
  good at it.  Within about eight hours, I had solved roughly 90% of
  the puzzles.  I finished at the top of the scoreboard.
</p>

<p>
  In my younger days, I was generally known to be a good problem
  solver.  I was often consulted when thorny problems needed solving
  and I usually managed to deliver results.  I also enjoyed solving
  puzzles.  I had a knack for them and happily spent hours, sometimes
  days, working through obscure mathematical or technical puzzles and
  sharing detailed write-ups with friends of the nerd variety.  So
  tackling arcane and seemingly pointless puzzles was very much my
  thing.  Seen in that light, my performance at the CTF probably
  should not have surprised me.  Still, I was very pleased.  It was
  reassuring to know that I could still rely on my systems programming
  experience to solve obscure challenges.
</p>
<p>
  During the course of the contest, my performance became something of
  a talking point in the office.  Colleagues occasionally stopped by
  my desk to appreciate how well I was doing in the CTF.  Two much
  younger colleagues, both engineers I admired for their skill and
  professionalism, were discussing the results nearby.  They were
  speaking softly, but I could still overhear parts of their
  conversation.  Curious, I leaned slightly and listened a bit more
  carefully.  I simply wanted to know what these two people, whom I
  admired a great deal, thought about my performance.
</p>
<p>
  One of them remarked on how well I was doing in the contest.  The
  other replied, 'Of course he is doing well.  He has more than ten
  years of experience in C.'  At that moment, I realised that no
  matter how well I solved those puzzles, the result would naturally
  be credited to experience.  In my younger days, when I solved tricky
  problems, people would sometimes call me smart.  Now it was simply
  expected.  Not that I particularly care for such labels anyway, but
  it did make me realise how things had changed.  I was now simply the
  person with many years of experience, and solving challenges that
  involved dissecting binaries and solving technical puzzles was
  expected rather than remarkable.
</p>
<p>
  I continue to sharpen my technical skills to this day.  While my
  technical results may now simply be attributed to experience, I hope
  I can continue to make a good impression through my professionalism,
  ethics and kindness towards the people I work with.  If those leave
  a lasting impression, that is good enough for me.
</p>
