  Here is a silly little C puzzle:
</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
    https://susam.net/
    printf("hello, world\n");
    return 0;
}</code></pre>
<p>
  This code compiles and runs successfully.
</p>
<pre><samp>$ <kbd>c99 hello.c &amp;&amp; ./a.out</kbd>
hello, world</samp></pre>
<p>
  However, the
  <a href="http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n1256.pdf">C99
  standard draft</a> does not mention anywhere that a URL is a valid
  syntactic element in C.  How does this code work then?
</p>
<p>
  <em><strong>Update on 04 Jun 2011:</strong> The puzzle has been
  solved in the <a href="comments/url-in-c.html">comments</a> section.
  If you want to think about the problem before you see the solutions,
  this is a good time to pause and think about it.  There are spoilers
  ahead.</em>
</p>
<p>
  The code works fine because <code>https:</code> is a label and
  <code>//</code> following it begins a comment.  In case, you are
  wondering if <code>//</code> is indeed a valid comment in C, yes, it
  is, since C99.  Download the
  <a href="http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n1256.pdf">C99
  standard draft</a>, go to section 6.4.9 (Comments) and read the
  second point which mentions this:
</p>
<blockquote>
  Except within a character constant, a string literal, or a comment,
  the characters <code>//</code> introduce a comment that includes all
  multibyte characters up to, but not including, the next new-line
  character.  The contents of such a comment are examined only to
  identify multibyte characters and to find the terminating new-line
  character.
</blockquote>
