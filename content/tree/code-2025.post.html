<p>
  In this post, I return with a retrospective on my coding adventures,
  where I summarise my hobby projects and recreational programming
  activities from the current year.  I did the last such retrospective
  in <a href="code-2023.html">2023</a>.  So I think this is a good
  time to do another retrospective.
</p>
<p>
  At the outset, I should mention that I have done less hobby
  computing this year than in the past few, largely because I spent a
  substantial portion of my leisure time studying Galois theory and
  algebraic graph theory.  In case you are wondering where I am
  learning these subjects from, the books are <em>Galois Theory</em>,
  5th ed. by Ian Stewart and <em>Algebraic Graph Theory</em> by Godsil
  and Royle.  Both are absolutely fascinating subjects and the two
  books I mentioned are quite good as well.  I highly recommend them.
</p>
<p>
  Now back to the coding adventures.  Here they go:

      <a href="https://github.com/susam/mathb">MathB</a>: The year
      began not with the release of a new project but with the
      opposite: discontinuing a project I had maintained for 13 years.
      MathB.in, a mathematics pastebin service, was discontinued early
      this year.  This is a project I developed in 2012 for myself and
      my friends.  Although a rather simple project, it was close to
      my heart, as I have many fond memories of exchanging
      mathematical puzzles and solutions with my friends using this
      service.  Over time, the project grew quite popular on IRC
      networks, as well as in some schools and universities, where IRC
      users, learners and students used the service to share problems
      and solutions with one another, much as my friends and I had
      done in its early days.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shut it down this year because I wanted to move on from the
      project.  Before the shutdown, a kind member of the
      <a href="https://wiki.archiveteam.org/">Archive Team</a> worked
      with me to
      <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://mathb.in/">archive</a>
      all posts from the now-defunct website.  Although shutting down
      this service was a bittersweet event for me, I feel relieved
      that I no longer have to run a live service in my spare time.
      While this was a good hobby ten years ago, it no longer is.  See
      my blog post
      <a href="mathbin-is-shutting-down.html">MathB.in Is Shutting
      Down</a> for more details on the reasons behind this decision.
      The source code of this project remains open source and
      available at
      <a href="https://github.com/susam/mathb">github.com/susam/mathb</a>.

      <a href="https://github.com/susam/quickqwerty">QuickQWERTY</a>:
      This is a touch-typing tutor that runs in a web browser.  I
      originally developed it in 2008 for myself and my friends.
      While I learnt touch typing on an actual typewriter as a child,
      those lessons did not stick with me.  Much later, while I was at
      university, I came across a Java applet-based touch-typing tutor
      that finally helped me learn touch typing properly.  I disliked
      installing Java plugins in the web browser, which is why I later
      developed this project in plain HTML and JavaScript.  This year,
      I carried out a major refactoring to collapse the entire project
      into a single standalone HTML file with no external
      dependencies.  The source code has been greatly simplified as
      well.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was younger and more naive, inspired by the complexity
      and multiple layers of abstraction I saw in popular open source
      and professional projects, I tended to introduce similar
      abstractions and complexity into my personal projects.  Over
      time, however, I began to appreciate simplicity.  The new code
      for this project is smaller and simpler.  I am quite happy with
      the end result.  You can take a look at the code here:
      <a href="https://github.com/susam/quickqwerty/blob/main/quickqwerty.html">quickqwerty.html</a>.
      If you want to use the typing tutor, go here:
      <a href="quickqwerty.html">QuickQWERTY</a>.  Unfortunately, it
      does not support keyboard layouts other than QWERTY.  When I
      originally developed this project, my view of the computing
      world was rather limited.  I was not even aware that other
      keyboard layouts existed.  You are, however, very welcome to
      fork the project and adapt the lessons for other layouts.

      <a href="https://github.com/susam/cfrs">CFRS[]</a>: This project
      was my first contribution to the quirky world of esolangs.
      CFRS[] is an extremely minimal drawing language consisting of
      only six simple commands: <code>C</code>, <code>F</code>,
      <code>R</code>, <code>S</code>, <code>[</code> and
      <code>]</code>.  I developed it in 2023 and have since been
      maintaining it with occasional bug fixes.  This year, I
      <a href="https://github.com/susam/cfrs/commit/9bae21f">fixed an
      annoying bug</a> that caused the drawing canvas to overflow on
      some mobile web browsers.  A new demo also arrived from the
      community this year and has now been added to the community demo
      page.  See
      <a href="https://susam.github.io/cfrs/demo.html#glimmering-galaxy">Glimmering
      Galaxy</a> for the new demo.  If you want to play with CFRS[]
      now, visit <a href="cfrs.html">CFRS[]</a>.

      <a href="https://github.com/susam/fxyt">FXYT</a>: This is
      another esolang project of mine.  This too is a minimal drawing
      language, though not as minimal as CFRS[].  Instead, it is a
      stack-based, postfix canvas colouring language with only 36
      simple commands.  The canvas overflow bug described in the
      previous entry affected this project as well.  That has now been
      fixed.  Further, by popular demand, the maximum allowed code
      length has been increased from 256 bytes to 1024 bytes.  This
      means there is now more room for writing more complex FXYT
      programs.  Additionally, the maximum code length for
      distributable demo links has been increased from 64 bytes to 256
      bytes.  This allows several more impressive demos to have their
      own distributable links.  Visit <a href="fxyt.html">FXYT</a> to
      try it out now.  See also the
      <a href="https://susam.github.io/fxyt/demo.html">Community Demos</a> to

      <a href="https://github.com/susam/nq">Nerd Quiz</a>: This is a
      new project I created a couple of months ago.  It is a simple
      HTML tool that lets you test your nerdiness through short
      quizzes.  Each question is drawn from my everyday moments of
      reading, writing, thinking, learning and exploring.  The project
      is meant to serve as a repository of interesting facts I come
      across in daily life, captured in the form of quiz questions.
      Go here to try it out: <a href="nq.html">Nerd Quiz</a>.  I hope
      you will enjoy these little bits of knowledge as much as I
      enjoyed discovering them.

      <a href="primegrid.html">Prime Number Grid Explorer</a>: This is
      a simple prime number grid visualiser I wrote for fun.  It plots
      the prime numbers in a grid where you can set the number of rows
      and the number of columns.  It uses the Miller-Rabin primality
      test with bases drawn from
      <a href="https://oeis.org/A014233">oeis.org/A014233</a> to
      determine whether a number is prime.  This allows it to
      accurately test whether a number is prime up to
      3317044064679887385961980.  For example,
      <a href="primegrid.html#3317044064679887385961781-20-10">this
      grid</a> shows the upper limit of the numbers this tool can
      check. The three circles displayed there represent the prime
      numbers 3317044064679887385961783, 3317044064679887385961801 and
      3317044064679887385961813.

      <a href="https://github.com/susam/mvs">Mark V. Shaney
      Junior</a>: Finally, I have my own Markov gibberish generator.
      Always wanted to have one.  The project is inspired by the
      legendary Usenet bot named Mark V. Shaney that used to post
      messages to various newsgroups in the 1980s.  My Markov chain
      program is written in about 30 lines of Python.  I ran it on my
      24 years of blog posts consisting of over 200 posts and about
      200,000 words and it generated some pretty interesting
      gibberish.  See my blog post
      <a href="fed-24-years-of-posts-to-markov-model.html">Fed 24
      Years of My Posts to Markov Model</a> to see the examples.

      <a href="elliptical-python-programming.html">Elliptical Python
      Programming</a>: If the previous item was not silly enough, this
      one surely is.  Earlier this year, I wrote a blog post
      describing the fine art of Python programming using copious
      amounts of ellipses.  I will not discuss it further here to
      avoid spoilers.  I'll just say that any day I'm able to do
      something pointless, whimsical and fun with computers is a good
      day for me.  And it was a good day when I wrote this post.
      Please visit the link above to read the post.  I hope you find
      it fun.

      Cosines</a>: Another silly post in which I explain how to
      compute the discrete Fourier transform of the Fizz Buzz sequence
      and derive a closed-form expression that can be used to print
      the sequence.

  That wraps up my coding adventures for this year.  There were fewer
  hobby projects than usual but I enjoyed spending more time learning
  new things and revisiting old ones.  One long-running project came
  to an end, another was cleaned up and a few small new ideas appeared
  along the way.  Looking forward to what the next year brings.
