  I have recently switched from ZNC to Soju as my IRC bouncer.  I
  already like it quite a bit.  No more manually maintaining a
  configuration file for my various IRC connections.

<p>
  On Debian 13 (trixie), it is quite straightforward to set it up.
  Here are some example commands that show how straightforward it is
  to set it up.

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install soju
sudo sojuctl user create -username soju -password PASSWORD_GOES_HERE
sudo sojuctl user run soju network create -addr irc.libera.chat -nick YOUR_NICK
</pre>
