A Friend is a Must

Friendship's the wine of life - says Young Edward.
The bible states - A faithful friend is the medicine of life.
I can dare to say, a friend is the nicest reward,
In fact a medicine you should have far and wide.
A friend cleanses your dirtiest dust
And so I say - A friend is a must.

If there is not a friend to name,
If there is not a person to help;
You are a candle without a flame,
A person who can't ever see himself.
A friend is one you truly trust
And so I say - A friend is a must.

To live a life in high spirits,
You need a friend far and near.
To illume your minikin merits
You need a friend very dear.
A friend never lets rights rust
And so I say - A friend is a must.

A person who judges you very right,
In your life who makes amend,
A person who serves as your guide,
Such a person is your friend.
A friend is with you in the biggest bust
And so I say - A friend is a must.

A friend is a person who is almost a mother,
Who can play the role of a father as well,
Who never lets you get into hot water,
Who is always there in your boat to sail.
A friend searches you in the greatest gust
And so I say - A friend is a must.

To have a friend is a vast plus
And so I say - A friend is a must.
To be deprived of it is the worst curse
And so I say - A friend is a must.
A friend is a must, a friend is a must.
I repeat - a friend is a must.
