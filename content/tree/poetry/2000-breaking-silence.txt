Breaking Silence

You may feel I'll forget you
In the many lonely years to come,
But it'll prove to absolutely true
Only on 31st day of the 4th month.

A friend once forgotten is a person,
In our case it is very different,
Though insincerity of mine has been the obvious trend,
But you're not any person, you're a friend.

I broke my so called inaudible silence
When you wrote your blues in a letter much later.
I am a stupid guy, says the apparent occurrence.
Please forgive me as you know it better.

You are there in the core of my core
And don't you ever try to deny that.
I need not bore you any more
Because the word 'friend' itself is the greatest fact.
