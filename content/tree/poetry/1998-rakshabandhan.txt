Rakshabandhan

Night after night the moon alters its phase,
Month after month to be full it swells
To shower on us its milky rays
But in none of them delight dwells
As much as it does on that full-moon night,
When to me the moon is utterly bright,
When the silver disc illumes the earth gleefully
And ushers in Rakshabandhan with its ecstacy.

This is the day for which every year I wait
When you are there with the lovely thread bracelet
To tie on my wrist exquisite love's emblem
And I accord you toffees with love amidst them.

I wish these moments pause forever
And stay with me with the fragrance,
But doesn't relent the time austere
And soon it bereaves me of their presence.

Then comes again the annoying mundane
With those moments treasured in my heart, I live;
And of course with a duty to promptly lend
You a helping hand whenever you need
So here is a promise I make, my dear sister;
That whenever you feel you need to count on me,
Just turn behind and I'll be right there
To succour you whatever the plight may be.
