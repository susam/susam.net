Dawn Dawns

When the sun goes down and the night sets in,
The colours around us are hard to see,
But look above, the stars are blinking,
Sailing across the sky very slowly.
Assuring us that time goes on,
That the night would end and dawn would dawn.

When the heart breaks and the pain is overwhelming,
Thoughts are gloomy and feelings are clumsy,
But be calm and strong, count each blessing
That is still with you, holding up firmly.
They will live and grief would be gone.
The heart would mend and joy would dawn.
