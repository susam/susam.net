<p>
  Here are some details about how this website is maintained and
  published:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      This website runs on a <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> system.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      This website is served
      using <a href="https://packages.debian.org/stable/nginx">Nginx</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      This website is generated statically using a small
      <a href="https://github.com/susam/susam.net/blob/main/site.lisp">Common
        Lisp program</a>.  This program is available under the terms of
      the MIT license.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Every line of HTML and CSS that makes this website is
      handcrafted.  The final HTML pages, however, are generated using
      a Common Lisp program.  This program merely combines the
      handcrafted HTML content with a handcrafted HTML layout to
      generate the pages that are served over the web.  The content
      HTML, layout HTML, and the Common Lisp program were all written
      from scratch.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      All web pages on this website are
      <a href="https://github.com/susam/susam.net/blob/08a2d7b/Makefile#L372-L377">validated
      using HTML Tidy</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      While most of this website is made of static HTML pages served
      via Nginx, the pages for the comment and subscriber forms are
      dynamic in nature.  They are implemented using Common Lisp and
      Hunchentoot.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      This website has a <a href="pages.html">site-wide page list</a>
      that includes every page on this website.  It doesn't matter if
      the page is part of a blog, a standalone HTML tool, or an HTML
      game.  Every single web page on this website occurs in this
      list.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      This website has a <a href="links.html">links page</a> that has
      pointers to various sections of my website.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      This website has a <a href="tag/{{ index }}">tag list page</a>
      that can be used to browse this website by topics.  Clicking on
      any tag on the tag list page, presents a list of all web pages
      that have been marked with that tag.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      This website provides a consolidated <a href="feed.xml">web feed
      (RSS)</a>.  The Common Lisp program mentioned earlier ensures
      that every new web page that appears on this website also
      appears in this web feed.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Every tag has its own web feed.  For example,
      see <a href="tag/technology.html">tag/technology.html</a> for a
      list of all pages tagged "Technology" and then
      see <a href="tag/technology.xml">tag/technology.xml</a> for the
      corresponding web feed.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The web feeds are sparingly styled with
      <a href="feed.xsl">XSLT</a>.  Web browsers that support XSL
      transformation for web feeds render the feeds as HTML (rather
      than raw XML) as determined by the stylesheet.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Every directory and subdirectory on this website has a directory
      listing page that lists all its files and subdirectories.
      See <a href="ls.html">ls.html</a> for an example.  Subdirectory
      names are marked with a trailing slash.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      This website loads KaTeX to render LaTeX snippets on web pages
      that contain mathematical formulas.  For example, see the page
      <a href="integrating-factor.html">integrating-factor.html</a>.
      KaTeX is not loaded on other web pages.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      All internal links on this website are relative links.  In fact,
      all internal resources like the stylesheet, KaTeX, etc. too are
      loaded using relative links.  Doing so allows me to browse this
      website locally from my local drive without having to run a web
      server on my development system.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    All web pages on this website have been
    <a href="https://github.com/susam/susam.net/blob/08a2d7b/Makefile#L379-L383">validated
    to ensure that there are no broken internal links</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      When you visit any web page on this website, all resources are
      loaded from this website and only this website.  No external
      resources are loaded.  This ensures that when you visit this
      website, no data about your client is transmitted to another web
      server.
