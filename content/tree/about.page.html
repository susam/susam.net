<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi!  I am Susam Pal.  Welcome to my website.  This page provides a
  brief introduction about me and this website.
</p>
<p>
  I am a software engineer by profession.  I have a keen interest in
  free and open source software.  My first non-trivial contribution to
  open source was
  <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NUTCH-559">NUTCH-559</a>
  in 2007.  That contribution added support for various authentication
  schemes to Apache Nutch, an open source web crawler.  I have
  remained active in the open source communities since then.  I also
  develop and maintain a few open source projects of my own at
  <a href="https://github.com/susam">github.com/susam</a>.  For a list
  of my projects, see my <a href="foss.html">open source work
  details</a>.
</p>
<p>
  When not involved with technology, I like reading books, playing the
  piano and travelling.
</p>
<h2 id="irc">IRC</h2>
<p>
  I am usually online as my IRC nick <em>susam</em> on
  <a href="https://web.libera.chat/">Libera IRC</a>.  I hang out at
  various channels like #algorithms, #commonlisp, #emacs, #python,
  etc.
</p>
<p>
  The #algorithms channel was founded by me first on Freenode in 2007
  when there was no such channel dedicated to the subject of
  algorithms.  It started as a tiny community of about 10 members from
  the ##math channel and then gradually grew to have over 200 members
  within a few years.  The channel was then
  <a href="algorithms-channel-migrates-to-libera-chat.html">migrated</a>
  to Libera in 2021.
</p>
<h2 id="website">Website</h2>
<p>
  This website is generated using a Common Lisp program.  Most of this
  website is static in nature.  The
  <a href="form/comment/{{ index }}?p=about">comment form</a> on this
  website is served dynamically using a tiny web server program
  written in Common Lisp.  See
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/susam.net">github.com/susam/susam.net</a>
  for the source code of this website.
</p>
<p>
  Every line of HTML and CSS that makes this website is handcrafted.
  See <a href="colophon.html">colophon.html</a> for more details about
  how this website is written and run.
</p>
<p>
  The primary copy of this website is hosted at
  <a href="https://susam.net/">susam.net</a>.  A mirror of the
  website is hosted at
  <a href="https://susam.github.io/">susam.github.io</a>.
</p>
<p>
  This website began its life as an intranet portal running on an
  intranet server out of my dorm room during my university days back
  in 2001-2005.  That intranet server was named <code>maze</code>.  I
  used to run that server for my fellow students in our university's
  computer network.  The server used to host an FTP server and an HTTP
  portal for mathematical puzzles, technical articles, free software
  downloads and audio/video streaming.  While that intranet portal and
  its source code written in Classic ASP are now long gone, some of
  its content still survives on this website.
</p>
<h2 id="browse">Browse</h2>
<p>
  The <a href="./{{ index }}">home page</a> of this website presents
  my primary blog.  I write about technology, mathematics and other
  miscellaneous topics on this blog.  The posts on my primary blog
  often tend to be long-form, involved and detailed.  They sometimes
  take considerable time to write and publish.  As a result, the
  interval between two posts on this blog can range from several weeks
  to months.
</p>
<p>
  I also archive notes, code and various miscellaneous files on other
  sections of this website that I update more frequently than my
  primary blog.  Visit <a href="links.html">links.html</a> to find
  quick links to my primary blog as well as other sections of this
  website.
</p>
<h2 id="guestbook">Guestbook</h2>
<p>
  This website has a simple, old-fashioned guestbook.  Please
  visit <a href="guestbook.html">guestbook.html</a> if you would like
  to leave a comment.
</p>
<h2 id="blogroll">Blogroll</h2>
<p>
  This website has a blogroll.  On a particularly hot summer day in
  June 2025, with temperatures soaring to 31&nbsp;&deg;C, I decided to
  write a small Common Lisp program that generates a page with links
  to recent entries from my favourite blogs.  To check my blogroll,
  please visit <a href="roll.html">roll.html</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I have found this to be a great way to keep up with my feeds.
  Thanks to this section of my website, I no longer use feed readers
  or aggregators.  I could never quite make a habit of using them
  regularly anyway.
</p>
<p>
  Credit for this nifty and very effective idea of using my blogroll
  as my feed reader goes to Alex Kladov!  It was Alex's
  website, <a href="https://matklad.github.io/">matklad.github.io</a>,
  that inspired me to implement <a href="roll.html">my own
  blogroll</a>.

<h2 id="colours">Colours</h2>
<p>
  This website supports both light and dark colour schemes.  The
  information box below shows the colour scheme selected right now.
</p>
<p class="light highlight">
  The <strong>light colour scheme</strong> is active currently.
</p>
<p class="dark highlight">
  The <strong>dark colour scheme</strong> is active currently.
</p>
<p>
  If you would like to browse this website using the opposite colour
  scheme, please check if your operating system or web browser
  supports changing the preferred colour scheme.  Most modern
  operating systems do support it.
</p>
<h2 id="name">Name</h2>
<p>
  I have been told many times that my name, <em>"Susam"</em>, is a
  little unusual which makes it difficult for others to figure how to
  pronounce it.  It is pronounced almost like the English
  words <em>"sue sum"</em> (/suːsʌm/).  However you may call my name
  however you find most natural, convenient or intuitive.  I do not
  mind mispronunciations of my name at all whatsoever.
