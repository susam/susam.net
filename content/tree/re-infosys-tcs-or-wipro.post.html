  The <a href="infosys-tcs-or-wipro.html">"Infosys, TCS or Wipro?"</a>
  post is doing the rounds again and some hatred as well as love is
  arriving via email.  I can understand when someone dislikes the way
  I have expressed the whole matter in that blog post.  But I fail to
  understand the motivation behind some employees of these
  organisations trying to justify that working there is almost as good
  as working for a company where one can work with a team of very
  talented engineers.  The earlier post was discussed and debated on
  <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2628318">Hacker News</a> and
  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/lqemo">Reddit</a>.  In
  this post, I'll address some of the points discussed in these debates.

      <strong>India needs IT services companies:</strong> The most
      popular argument by Indian commenters has been that India needs
      IT services companies because they make a lot of money and boost
      India's economy.  This is a straw man.  I have never said
      anything to the contrary.  In fact, I agree with this point.
      However, in my opinion, students who have learnt their
      engineering well during the engineering course and who now want
      to improve their engineering skills in their professional lives
      should not work for one of these companies.  They should
      join <a href="infosys-tcs-or-wipro.html#suggestion">a startup or
      a company known for hiring skilled engineers</a>.

      <strong>Business problems vs engineering problems:</strong>
      Another popular argument has been that a software company is not
      a place to demonstrate your engineering talent.  Many argue that
      it is a place to solve business problems, not engineering
      problems.  I disagree with this very firmly.  Business problems
      and engineering problems are not mutually exclusive.  The reason
      why many employees of these companies feel that solving a
      business problem wouldn't involve solving an engineering problem
      is that they are not skilled enough to even realise whether a
      particular business problem has an engineering solution.  I've
      mentioned in my earlier post that engineering problems are there
      in every software company.  It needs the mind of an engineer to
      identify those problems and solve them correctly.  Not all
      string parsing problems should be solved with a chain of string
      library functions stitched together.  Some string processing and
      parsing work can be done more efficiently and reliably by coding
      a simple DFA.  Not all data should be maintained as records in
      an array.  Some need to be maintained as graphs.  A superficial
      knowledge of regular expressions can be dangerous if one does
      not know what kind of patterns they cannot express.

      <strong>Business problems and engineering problems:</strong> If
      you want to solve business problems and keep your customers
      happy, Infosys, TCS or Wipro might be the right place for you.
      If you want to solve business problems, keep your customers
      happy and learn a great deal of engineering while doing so, you
      need to find another workplace where you can work with a team of
      skilled engineers who you can give you constructive feedback on
      your work.

      <strong>Engineering in Adobe, Amazon, Google, etc.:</strong> A
      popular myth that prevails among many is that there is no
      engineering work to do in the Indian offices of Adobe, Amazon,
      Google, etc.  I'll reiterate that there is engineering work to
      do in every software company, even in Infosys, TCS and Wipro.
      It really depends on the people whether they want to take
      engineering seriously or not.  Some people would somehow develop
      the required software by stitching together library functions
      and give up or look for inefficient workarounds when a
      particular task requires inventing a new engineering solution.
      There is another kind of people who are ready to invent new
      engineering solutions with all the engineering knowledge they
      have.  They do not hesitate to reinvent the wheel when the
      existing libraries do not meet the requirements of the
      particular problem at hand.  Such engineers are more in number
      in startups like Gluster, Parallocity, SlideShare, etc. and
      companies like Adobe, Amazon, Google, Phoenix, RSA, etc.  These
      companies also collaborate with universties to learn new
      techniques and concepts to solve business problems.  These
      companies do not look for inefficient workarounds when faced
      with a brick wall.  They challenge themselves and do everything
      possible to solve a problem in the best possible way.  These are
      the places where fresh engineering graduates can hope to learn a
      great deal of engineering from people around them.

      <strong>Passionate people can do engineering anywhere:</strong>
      Another popular argument is that it doesn't matter where you
      work.  One can do engineering anywhere, be it Google or Infosys.
      I agree with this.  But then, given a place like Adobe, Amazon
      or Google where the culture and the environment encourages good
      engineering and another place like Infosys, TCS or Wipro where
      people are generally clueless about good engineering, where do
      you think you are going to learn more and improve yourself
      faster?

      <strong>But not everyone can join Adobe, Amazon, Google,
      etc.:</strong> Well, I never said that everyone should get into
      a reputed software product company.  Not everyone wants to make
      a career in engineering.  Some people have other goals in life.
      They just want a regular job.  It sounds perfectly fine to me.
      My post was written for those who aspire to make a career in
      engineering.  In my opinion, they should try to get into a
      reputed software product company or a startup that is known to
      hire skilled engineers.  If they aren't well prepared, the only
      thing they can do is to prepare well to fulfill their
      aspirations.  Some people say that they should join Infosys, TCS
      and Wipro to earn a living while they are preparing and I think
      it's a great advice.  I'll suggest considering contributing some
      new features or bug-fixes they would like to see in some open
      source project.
      <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/">Apache Incubator</a> has a
      lot of budding projects.  They can also consider authoring their
      own open source projects.  They can also try solving problems at
      <a href="http://community.topcoder.com/tc">TopCoder</a>,
      <a href="http://www.codechef.com/">CodeChef</a>,
      <a href="http://www.spoj.pl/">SPOJ</a>,
      <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>, etc. to
      improve their algorithm skills.  These are good ways of preparing
      in my opinion.

      <strong>Infosys, TCS and Wipro have good engineers:</strong>
      Many people have told me that there are good engineers in
      Infosys, TCS and Wipro as well.  I agree.  I never mentioned
      that 100% of the engineers in these companies are clueless about
      engineering.  I mentioned that the majority of them are
      clueless.  In fact, drawing from my personal experience, I
      quoted a figure that only 1 out of 200 are capable of good
      engineering in these companies.  Like most guess work, this
      figure could be wrong but I am pretty confident that the bigger
      picture I am trying to paint here isn't.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li id="training">
    <p>
      <strong>Training:</strong> Many claimed that I am wrong about
      the poor standard of training programs in Infosys, TCS or Wipro.
      I must tell them that I have attended some of these training
      programs myself.  Among the many horror stories pertaining to
      training in these companies, let me share only one with you to
      make my point.  In the training assessments, the instructors set
      question papers containing problems with
      <a href="sequence-points.html">code that invokes undefined
      behaviour</a> and ask you to predict its output.  "It invokes
      undefined behaviour" is not provided as an option you can select
      as the correct answer.  Such training and knowledge is not only
      wrong but also very dangerous.  This kind of flawed knowledge
      leads to the development of unreliable, fragile and insecure
      software.

  <li id="meritocracy">
    <p>
      <strong>Meritocracy:</strong> A few friends of mine expressed
      that I should have mentioned that these companies do not
      practice meritocracy.  Anyone with sufficient number of years of
      experience can get a promotion in these companies.  It didn't
      occur to me while writing the earlier post but this is true.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li id="leaving">
    <p>
      <strong>Leaving Infosys, TCS or Wipro:</strong> Some commenters
      commented that people like me just leave these companies and
      discourage others from joining them.  They feel that we choose
      the easy way out.  They would rather have us stay in these
      companies and improve them.  Firstly, getting a job in a reputed
      company with a strong engineering culture is definitely not the
      easy way out.  You have to be passionate about your area of
      interest in technology.  You have to work hard and prepare
      yourself for it.  Secondly, Infosys, TCS and Wipro were made by
      their founders with a particular vision of providing IT
      services.  They have achieved what they wanted with great
      success.  The improvements that you want us to make in these
      companies may not be consistent with the vision of the founders.
      It makes more sense for us to join companies where the vision of
      the founders is consistent with our aspiration for doing good
      engineering work.

      <strong>Solving algorithm problems vs editing
      configuration:</strong> This has to be the strangest argument I
      have come across.  Someone mentioned that a person who solves
      algorithm problems earns no more than someone who only edits
      configuration files.  After seeing both sides of the software
      industry, I find this false.  Solving an algorithm problem is
      one thing.  Solving an algorithm problem efficiently is an
      entirely different thing.  I have seen people who can solve
      difficult algorithm problems efficiently in a company with a
      strong engineering culture earning at least three times to five
      times more than those working for Infosys, TCS or Wipro.

<p>
  To summarise, the <a href="infosys-tcs-or-wipro.html">earlier
  post</a> was meant for and only for people are interested in solving
  engineering problems.  I have known many such people who were good
  engineers but weren't aware of the reality in companies like
  Infosys, TCS or Wipro before joining them.  That post was meant for
  these people.
