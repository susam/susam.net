<p>
  Hello!  With this post, I am starting a new section on this website
  called <em>RWX</em>.  The posts in this section are going to contain
  bits and fragments of stuff I have been reading, writing, or
  exploring in the previous few weeks.  Usually these bits and
  fragments would cover topics and ideas that were not substantial
  enough to deserve their own complete blog posts but that I still
  want to archive in some form on my website.  Let us get started with
  the first post of this section.

<h2 id="grothendieck-prime">Grothendieck Prime</h2>
<p>
  Quoting from the article
  <a href="https://www.ams.org/notices/200410/fea-grothendieck-part2.pdf">Comme
  Appelé du Néant&mdash;As If Summoned from the Void: The Life of
  Alexandre Grothendieck</a> by Allyn Jackson published in <em>Notices
  of the AMS, Volume 51, Number 10</em>:
</p>
<blockquote>
  One striking characteristic of Grothendieck's mode of thinking is
  that it seemed to rely so little on examples.  This can be seen in
  the legend of the so-called "Grothendieck prime".  In a mathematical
  conversation, someone suggested to Grothendieck that they should
  consider a particular prime number.  "You mean an actual number?"
  Grothendieck asked.  The other person replied, yes, an actual prime
  number.  Grothendieck suggested, “All right, take 57.”

<h2 id="logarithm-notation">Logarithm Notation</h2>
<p>
  We know that the natural logarithm of a number \( x, \) i.e., the
  logarithm of \( x \) to the base \( e, \) is sometimes denoted as \(
  \ln x.  \) It has other notations too.  For example, many
  mathematics textbook just use the notation \( \log x \) after
  establishing once that this notation denotes the natural logarithm.
  The most descriptive notation is perhaps \( \log_e x \) but this is
  considered an overkill.  I have never seen any serious textbook use
  this notation.
</p>
<p>
  Let us focus on \( \ln x \) again.  Is it not peculiar?  What does
  \( \ln \) stand for really?  Logarithm natural?  Sounds very unnatural.
</p>
<p>
  Well, as a kid I learnt that \( \ln \) here stands for the Latin
  phrase "logarithmus naturalis".  It is only recently that I bothered
  to verify if this expansion of \( \ln x \) that I learnt as a kid is
  really true.  The most credible discussion of this that I could find
  online is this thread on Mathematics Stack
  Exchange: <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/q/1694">math.stackexchange.com/q/1694</a>.
  The answer by Dan Velleman points us to page 277 of an 1875
  book <em>Lehrbuch der Mathematik</em> by Anton Steinhauser.  Quoting
  the relevant portion from the page:
</p>
<blockquote>
  Man pflegt nun, um Verwechslungen dieser beiden Systeme vorzubeugen,
  mit log.nat. a (gesprochen: logarithmus naturalis a) oder ln . a,
  oder am einfachsten mit la den natürlichen, mit log.brigg. a
  (gesprochen: Logarithmus briggus a) oder log.a, oder am einfachsten
  mit lg. a den gemeinen Logarithmus (von a) zu bezeichnen.
</blockquote>
<p>
  Roughly translated to English, it says:
</p>
<blockquote>
  In order to prevent confusion between these two systems, people now
  use log.nat. a (pronounced: logarithmus naturalis a) or ln . a, or
  easiest with la the natural ones, with log.brigg. a (pronounced:
  logarithm briggus a) or log.a, or most simply with lg. a to denote
  the common logarithm (of a).
</blockquote>
<p>
  So it does look like what I learnt as a kid is correct and the
  earliest possible reference of this the Internet is able to find for
  us is the 1875 book quoted above.

<h2 id="random-string-in-shell">Random String in Shell</h2>
<p>
  Here is a quick way to generate a random alphanumeric string in the shell:
</p>
<pre><code>LC_CTYPE=C tr -dc '[:alnum:]' &lt; /dev/urandom | head -c 20; echo</code></pre>
<p>
  Here is an example output:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>LC_CTYPE=C tr -dc '[:alnum:]' &lt; /dev/urandom | head -c 20; echo</kbd>
T1WK1ni9BcWAr0cR44VA</samp>
</pre>
<h2 id="joke-sorting-algorithms">Joke Sorting Algorithms</h2>
<p>
  Sleepsort in shell:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>nums="5 1 3 6 2 4" sh -c 'for n in $nums; do sleep "$n" &amp;&amp; echo "$n" &amp; done; wait'</kbd>
1
2
3
4
5
6</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  Bogosort in Python:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>python3 -q</kbd>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>import random</kbd>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>nums = [5, 1, 3, 6, 2, 4]</kbd>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>while nums != sorted(nums): random.shuffle(nums)</kbd>
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>print(nums)</kbd>
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
&gt;&gt;&gt;</samp>

<h2 id="search-user-comment-on-jira">Search User Comment on Jira</h2>
<p>
  I have been using Jira for a very long time now.  I first came
  across it while contributing to Apache projects in 2006.  I find the
  search features of Jira to be remarkably clumsy and inadequate.
  Nevertheless, very recently I learnt to solve a common problem of
  mine.  Let us say, I know a user named <code>alice</code> has
  commented about a specific topic in some Jira ticket.  How do I find
  that ticket?  Here is the search filter for it:
</p>
<pre><code>issueFunction in commented("by alice") and comment ~ 'hello'</code></pre>
<p>
  The above example would search all comments by
  user <code>alice</code> that contains the
  string <code>'hello'</code>.  However one limitation of this
  solution is that the <code>issueFunction</code> field is provided by
  ScriptRunner for Jira to be available, so you need this app to be
  available in your Jira for this solution to work.
