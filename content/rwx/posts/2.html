  Hello and welcome to the second update from my
  <a href="./{{ index }}">random weekly explorations</a>.  These
  updates contain an assortment of topics with bits and pieces of
  stuff I have been reading, writing, or exploring over the past few
  weeks.  These updates tend to be short and insubstantial.  If you

<h2 id="perrons-paradox">Perron's Paradox</h2>
<p>
  Oskar Perron, a German mathematician, introduced Perron's paradox to
  illustrate the danger of assuming the existence of a solution to an
  optimisation problem.  The paradox works like this:
</p>
<div class="highlight">
  Let \( n \) be the largest positive integer.  Then either \( n = 1
  \) or \( n &gt; 1.  \) If \( n &gt; 1, \) then \( n^2 &gt; n, \)
  contradicting the definition of \( n. \) Hence \( n = 1. \)
</div>
<p>
  We get this absurd result because of the incorrect assumption that
  there exists an integer that is the largest of all the integers.

<h2 id="light-through-the-ages">Light Through the Ages</h2>
<p>
  <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/HistTopics/Light_1/">Light
  Through the Ages: Ancient Greece to Maxwell</a> is a very
  fascinating article written by J J O'Connor and E F Robertson in
  2002 that takes us through a journey of how our understanding of
  light has evolved over the last few millennia.  Here is an excerpt
  from the article:
</p>
<blockquote>
  The biggest breakthrough in ancient times was made by al-Haytham
  around 1000 AD. He argued that sight is due only to light entering
  the eye from an outside source and there is no beam from the eye
  itself.
</blockquote>
<p>
  The article then goes on to say:
</p>
<blockquote>
  He gave a number of arguments to support this claim, the most
  persuasive being the camera obscura, or pinhole camera.  Here light
  passes through a pinhole shining on a screen where an inverted image
  is observed.  Anyone visiting Edinburgh in Scotland should go to see
  the camera obscura there near the top of the Royal Mile and marvel
  at just how effective the camera obscura is in this enjoyable
  tourist attraction.
</blockquote>
<p>
  By the way, there is a camera obscura in the London too at Royal
  Observatory, Greenwich which offers pretty good view of the
  surroundings that includes Greenwich Park, the University of
  Greenwich, the River Thames, etc.  Here is a picture I took the last
  time I was there.

<h2 id="sqlalchemy-echo">SQLAlchemy Echo</h2>
<p>
  I often work with SQLAlchemy, an object-relational mapper (ORM)
  package available for Python, in order to read/write data from/to
  database.  While working with SQLAlchemy, I sometimes want to see
  the SQL statements that SQLAlchemy generates behind the scenes.  One
  of the simplest ways to do this during development time is to simply
  use the <code>echo</code> keyword argument while creating
  the <code>Engine</code> object.  Here is an example:
</p>
<pre><code>engine = create_engine("sqlite:///example.db", echo=True)</code></pre>
<p>
  Now whenever we use this <code>engine</code> to interact with the
  database, it logs all SQL statements along with the parameter lists
  for the SQL statements.  For example, if we define
  a <code>person</code> column with two columns,
  say, <code>name</code> and <code>city</code>, and use SQLAlchemy to
  insert data into this table, we may see a few lines of log that look
  like this:
</p>
<pre>
<code>2024-04-14 19:26:04,903 INFO sqlalchemy.engine.Engine INSERT INTO person (name, city) VALUES (?, ?)
2024-04-14 19:26:04,903 INFO sqlalchemy.engine.Engine [generated in 0.00006s] ('Alice', 'London')</code>
</pre>
<p>

  demonstrates this, visit this directory:

<h2 id="emacs-info-expressions">Emacs Info Expressions</h2>
<p>
  On <code>#emacs</code> IRC or Matrix channels, we often share
  references to the built-in Emacs documentation as Elisp expressions
  that look like this:
</p>
<pre><code>(info "(emacs) Basic Undo")</code></pre>
<p>
  The person who receives this info expression can visit the
  corresponding section of the manual simply by evaluating it.  For
  example, after copying the expression in Emacs, they could simply
  type <code>C-y C-x C-e</code> to paste the expression into a buffer
  and evaluate it immediately.  Of course, if they are logged into IRC
  via Emacs itself, then they can simply place the cursor right after
  the closing parenthesis and type <code>C-x C-e</code> to evaluate
  it.
</p>
<p>
  The sender can generate these Elisp expressions automatically by
  typing <code>C-0 c</code> in <code>Info-mode</code>.  Say, while
  helping another Emacs user we type <code>M-x info-apropos RET
  version control RET</code> and land on the section "Branches" and
  realise that this is the section that the person we are trying to
  help should read.  Now when we are on this section, we can simply
  type <code>C-0 c</code> and Emacs will copy the following expression to the kill ring:
</p>
<pre><code>(info "(emacs) Branches")</code></pre>
<h2 id="unix-line-discard">Unix Line Discard</h2>
<p>
  Type <code>C-u</code> (i.e., <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>u</kbd>) in Bash
  or Zsh to discard the current line of input.  To read more about it,
  enter <code>man bash</code> and then
  type <code>/unix-line-discard</code> to locate the relevant section
  of the manual.  Here is an excerpt:
</p>
<pre>
<code>unix-line-discard (C-u)
       Kill backward from point to the beginning of the line.
       The killed text is saved on the kill-ring.</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Similarly, for Zsh, type <code>man zshzle</code> and then
  type <code>/kill-whole-line</code>.  We find this:
</p>
<pre>
<code>kill-whole-line (^U) (unbound) (unbound)
       Kill the current line.</code>
</pre>
