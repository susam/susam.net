<p>
  At my current workplace, there are several engineers who have an
  affinity for combinatorics.  As a result, discussions about
  combinatorics problems often occur at the cafeteria.  Probability
  theory is another popular topic of discussion.  Of course, often
  combinatorics and probability theory go hand in hand.

<h2 id="recurrence-relation">Recurrence Relation</h2>
<p>
  At the cafeteria one day, I joined in on a conversation about
  combinatorics problems.  During the conversation, I happened to
  share the following problem:
</p>
<div class="highlight">
  <p>
    For integers \( n \ge 1 \) and \( k \ge 1 \),

    \[
      f_k(n) =
      \begin{cases}
        n                       &amp; \text{if } k = 1, \\
        \sum_{i=1}^n f_{k-1}(i) &amp; \text{if } k \ge 2.
      \end{cases}
    \]

    Find a closed-form expression for \( f_k(n) \).
  </p>
</div>
<h2 id="nested-loops">Nested Loops</h2>
<p>
  Soon after I shared the above problem, a colleague of mine shared
  this problem with me:
</p>
<div class="highlight">
  <p>
    Consider the following pseudocode with <code>k</code> nested
    loops:
  </p>
<pre>
<code>x = 0
for c<sub>1</sub> in 0 to (n - 1):
    for c<sub>2</sub> in 0 to (c<sub>1</sub> - 1):
        ...
            for c<sub>k</sub> in 0 to (c<sub>k-1</sub> - 1):
                x = x + 1</code>
</pre>
  <p>
    What is the final value of <code>x</code> after the outermost loop
    terminates?
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  With one problem each, we went back to our desks.  As I began
  solving the <em>nested loops</em> problem shared by my colleague, I
  realised that the solution to his problem led me to
  the <em>recurrence relation</em> in the problem I shared with him.
</p>
<p>
  In the <em>nested loops</em> problem, if \( k = 1 \), the final
  value of \( x \) after the loop terminates is \( x = n \).  This is
  also the value of \( f_1(n) \).
</p>
<p>
  If \( k = 2 \), the inner loop with counter \( c_2 \) runs once when
  \( c_1 = 0 \), twice when \( c_1 = 1 \) and so on.  When the loop
  terminates, \( x = 1 + 2 + \dots + n \).  Note that this series is
  same as \( f_2(n) = f_1(1) + f_1(2) + \dots + f_1(n) \).
</p>
<p>
  Extending this argument, we now see that for any \( k \ge 1 \), the
  final value of \( x \) is

  \[
    f_k(n) = f_{k-1}(1) + f_{k-1}(2) + \dots + f_{k-1}(n).
  \]

  In other words, the solution to his <em>nested loops</em> problem is
  the solution to my <em>recurrence relation</em> problem.  It was an
  interesting coincidence that the problems we shared with each other
  had the same solution.
</p>
<h2 id="closed-form-expression">Closed-Form Expression</h2>
<p>
  The closed form expression for the recurrence relation is

  \[
    f_k(n) = \binom{n + k - 1}{k}.
  \]

  It is quite easy to prove this using the principle of mathematical
  induction.  Since we know that this is also the result of
  the <em>nested loops</em> problem, we can also arrive at this result
  by another way.
</p>
<p>
  In the <em>nested loops</em> problem, the following inequalities are
  always met due to the loop conditions:

  \[
    n - 1 \ge c_1 \ge c_2 \ge \dots \ge c_k \ge 0.
  \]

  The variables \( c_1, c_2, \dots, c_k \) take all possible
  arrangements of integer values that satisfy the above inequalities.
  If we find out how many such arrangements are there, we will know
  how many times the variable \( x \) is incremented.
</p>
<p>
  Let us consider \( n - 1 \) similar balls and \( k \) similar
  sticks.  For every possible permutation of these balls and sticks,
  if we count the number of balls to the right of the \( i \)th stick
  where \( 1 \le i \le k \), we get a number that the variable \( c_i \)
  holds in some iteration of the \( i \)th loop.  Therefore the
  variable \( c_i \) is represented as the number of balls lying on
  the right side of the \( i \)th stick.
</p>
<p>
  The above argument holds good because the number of balls on the
  right side of the first stick does not exceed \( n - 1 \), the
  number of balls on the right side of the second stick does not
  exceed the number of balls on the right side of the first stick and
  so on.  Thus the inequalities mentioned earlier are always
  satisfied.  Also, any set of valid values for \( c_1, c_2, \dots,
  c_k \) can be represented as an arrangement of these sticks and
  balls.
</p>
<p>
  The number of permutations of \( n - 1 \) similar balls and \( k \)
  similar sticks is

  \[
    \frac{(n + k - 1)!}{(n - 1)! \, k!} = \binom{n + k - 1}{k}.
  \]

  This closed-form expression is the solution to both the
  <em>recurrence relation</em> problem and the <em>nested loops</em>
  problem.
