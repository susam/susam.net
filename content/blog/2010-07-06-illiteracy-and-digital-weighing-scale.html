<!-- title: Illiteracy and Digital Weighing Scale -->
<!-- tag: miscellaneous puzzle -->
<p>
  Here is a real life problem from a silica bricks factory in a small
  industrial town in India. There are illiterate workers who cannot
  identify decimal digits. The management team of the factory is
  trying to figure if there is a way for these workers to operate a
  digital weighing scale to fill buckets with a certain mass of a
  given material. For example, they may be asked to fill 5.3&nbsp;kg
  of a certain material in the bucket, i.e., decimal fractions are
  involved.

<p>
  If the factory were using a beam balance, this would have been an
  easy problem to solve. The workers could then place the required
  weight in one pan and keep pouring the material in the other pan
  until the beam appears to be balanced.
</p>
<p>
  However this factory uses a digital weighing scale which involves
  recognizing decimal digits to read the measurement. What do you
  think is the easiest way to train the workers to do their job
  without having to teach them how to count?
</p>
<p>
  I have a solution in mind which would involve configuring the
  digital weighing scale in a certain way for every measurement the
  workers have to make. I will propose this solution to the management
  team of the factory. But I would like to know any suggestions you
  have and take them into account as well before proposing my
  solution. I will also share the solution I have in mind after
  learning about your suggestions.

  <strong>Update on 08&nbsp;July&nbsp;2010:</strong> Prunthaban has
  suggested a solution in
  the <a href="comments/illiteracy-and-digital-weighing-scale.html#5">comments</a>
  section which is pretty much what I had in mind too. I will propose
  this solution to the factory. The solution works like this: Say the
  worker has to fill 5.3 kg of a certain material into the bucket. A
  literate supervisor first places 5.3&nbsp;kg of that material on the
  weighing scale. The instrument now shows "5.3&nbsp;kg" on its
  display. Now the remainder of the solution assumes that the digital
  weighing balance has a calibration wheel to calibrate the
  instrument. The supervisor turns the calibration wheel until the
  display shows "0.0"&nbsp;kg while the 5.3&nbsp;kg of material is
  still placed on it. Now the material is removed from the balance and
  the display shows "-5.3&nbsp;kg". Now all a worker needs to do is
  pour the given material on this calibrated balance until the display
  shows "0.0&nbsp;kg". As long as the workers can be taught to
  recognize the digit "0", this solution should work fine.

  <strong>Update on 05 Aug 2010:</strong> The above solution was
  successfully implemented in OCL India Limited, the silica bricks
  factory where this problem was faced. The digital weighing balance
  involved in the problem indeed had a calibration wheel, so the above
  solution worked for them. Thank you, Prunthaban and others who
  participated in this discussion.
