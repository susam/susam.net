<!-- title: Illiteracy and Digital Weighing Scale -->
<!-- tag: miscellaneous -->
<p>
Here is a real life problem from a factory. There are illiterate workers
who cannot identify decimal digits. The management team of the factory
is trying to figure if there is a way for these workers to operate a
digital weighing scale to fill buckets with a certain mass of a given
material. For example, they may be asked to fill 3.18 kg of a certain
material in the bucket, i.e., decimal fractions are involved.
</p>

<p>
If the factory were using a beam balance, this would have been an easy
problem to solve. The workers could then place the required weight in
one pan and keep pouring the material in another pan until the beam
appears to be balanced.
</p>

<p>
However this factory uses a digital weighing scale which involves
recognizing decimal digits to read the measurement. What do you think is
the easiest way to train the workers to do their job without having to
teach them how to count?
</p>

<p>
I have a solution in mind which would involve configuring the digital
weighing scale in a certain way for every measurement the workers have
to make. I will propose this solution to the management team of the
factory. But I would like to know any suggestions you have and take them
into account as well before proposing my solution. I will also share the
solution I have in mind after learning about your suggestions.

<strong>Update on 08 July 2010:</strong> Prunthaban has suggested a
solution in the <a href="comments/#5">comments</a> section which is pretty
much what I had in mind too. I will propose this solution to the the
factory. The solution works like this: Say the worker has to fill 6.35
kg of a certain material into the bucket. A literate supervisor first
places 6.35 kg of that material on the weighing scale. The instrument
now shows "6.35 kg" on its display. Now the remainder of the solution
assumes that the digital weighing balance has a calibration wheel to
calibrate the instrument. The supervisor turns the calibration wheel
until the display shows "0.00" kg while the 6.35 kg of material is still
placed on it. Now the material is removed from the balance and the
display shows "-6.35 kg". Now all a worker needs to do is pour the given
material on this calibrated balance until the display shows "0.00 kg".
So as long as the workers can be taught to recognize the digit "0", this
solution should work fine.

<strong>Update on 05 Aug 2010:</strong> The above solution was
successfully implemented in <a href="http://www.ocl.in/">OCL India
Limited</a>, the factory where this problem was faced. The digital
weighing balance they bought indeed had a calibration wheel, so the
above solution worked for them. Thank you, Prunthaban and others who
participated in this discussion.
