<h2 id="terminal-tricks">Terminal Tricks</h2>
<p>
  Open a Unix or Linux terminal emulator.  If you have Terminal.app on
  macOS, ensure that the "Use Option as Meta Key" option is enabled in
  its "Preferences" section.  Now type <code>foo bar baz</code>
  followed by <kbd>meta</kbd>+<kbd>b</kbd>
  (i.e., <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>b</kbd> or <kbd>option</kbd>+<kbd>b</kbd>
  on modern keyboards).  In a typical desktop environment with a
  typical and modern terminal emulator running a modern shell like
  Bash, Zsh, etc., the cursor should move backward by one word.  Now
  type <kbd>esc</kbd> <kbd>b</kbd>.  The cursor should move back again
  by one word.  Finally type <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>[</kbd> <kbd>b</kbd>
  and the same thing should happen again.  How are we able to perform
  the same operation in three different ways?
</p>
<p>
  Note that if the desktop environment or the terminal emulator or the
  set of shell key bindings is configured differently, the results may
  vary.  But we will assume that the typical defaults are in effect in
  the remainder of this post.  To understand why these three key
  sequences yield the same result, it might be a good exercise to run
  the command <code>cat</code> and type the three key sequences again.
  The three key sequences we are talking about are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <kbd>meta</kbd>+<kbd>b</kbd> (i.e., <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>b</kbd>
    or <kbd>option</kbd>+<kbd>b</kbd> on modern keyboards)
  </li>
  <li>
    <kbd>esc</kbd> <kbd>b</kbd>
  </li>
  <li>
    <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>[</kbd> <kbd>b</kbd>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  When we run <code>cat</code> and type the three key sequences
  mentioned above, the following output may appear:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>cat
^[b^[b^[b</kbd></samp>
</pre>
<p>
  The output shows that the terminal sends the same input
  to <code>cat</code> each time: the <em>escape</em> character that
  appears as <code>^[</code> in the output and the
  character <code>b</code>.  This becomes more apparent if instead of
  running <code>cat</code>, we run <code>od -t d1</code> and type the
  three key sequences followed
  by <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>d</kbd> <kbd>enter</kbd>:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>od -t d1
^[b^[b^[b</kbd>
0000000    27  98  27  98  27  98  10
0000007</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  Indeed decimal 27 is the code of the <em>escape</em> character.
  Similarly decimal 98 is the code of the character <code>b</code>.
</p>
<h2 id="control-codes">Control Codes</h2>
<p>
  Let us first discuss why typing <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>[</kbd>
  produces the <em>escape</em> character.  The
  character <code>[</code> has code 91 (binary 1011011) and holding
  the <kbd>ctrl</kbd> key while typing it results in a control code
  obtained by taking 91 (binary 1011011), keeping its five least
  significant bits, and discarding the rest.  We get the control code
  27 (binary 11011) as the result.  This is the code of
  the <em>escape</em> character.  This explains
  why <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>[</kbd> produces the <em>escape</em>
  character and why the <em>escape</em> character is represented
  as <code>^[</code> while typing it into the standard input.  The
  caret sign (<code>^</code>) here is a notation for
  the <code>ctrl</code> modifier.
</p>
<p>
  The following table provides some more examples of control codes
  that can be obtained by typing the <kbd>ctrl</kbd> key along with
  some other key.

<p>
  This explains why typing <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>g</kbd> in a modern
  terminal emulator produces an audible beep or a visual flash,
  why <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>h</kbd> erases a character, and so on.
  This also explains why we can type <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>[</kbd> in
  Vim to escape from insert mode to normal mode.  While we can
  type <em>escape</em> with the <kbd>esc</kbd> key on the keyboard, we
  can do so with the <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>[</kbd> key too within the
  terminal.
</p>
<p>
  The keen eyed may notice that the table above has lowercase letters
  in the first column but the second and third columns use the code of
  the corresponding uppercase letters.  The lowercase letters in the
  first column is merely a notation I am using in this post to
  identify the keys on a keyboard.  They don't actually mean lowercase
  characters.  In fact, the very early keyboards only had uppercase
  letters and they simply toggled the 7th least significant bit of the
  modified character to obtain the control code.
</p>
<p>
  By the way, an interesting thing worth noting here is that even if
  we do consider the code of the lowercase character and pick only its
  five least significant bits, we get the same control code as we
  would get if we started with the corresponding uppercase character.
  For example, consider the key sequence
  <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>g</kbd>.  The uppercase character <code>G</code>
  has the code 71 (decimal 1000111) and the lowercase
  character <code>g</code> has the code 103 (decimal 1100111).  The
  five least significant bits are equal in both.  So when we pick the
  five least significant bits and discard the rest, we get the same
  result, i.e., 7 (binary 111) which is the code of the <em>bell</em>
  character.  This is due to the fact that the five least significant
  bits of the code of a lowercase character is exactly the same as
  that of the corresponding uppercase character.  They differ only in
  their sixth least significant bit.  This is only an interesting
  observation.  It is of little significance though because like I
  mentioned earlier, the early keyboards only flipped a bit in the
  code of the uppercase characters when the <kbd>ctrl</kbd> modifier
  was applied.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to what we have discussed so far, some terminal
  emulators also implement a few special rules such as the following:
</p>
<table class="grid mono">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th rowspan="2">Key</th>
      <th colspan="3">Modified Character</th>
      <th colspan="3">Resulting Character</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Binary</th>
      <th>Decimal</th>
      <th>Character</th>
      <th>Binary</th>
      <th>Decimal</th>
      <th>Character</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody style="font-family: monospace, monospace">
    <tr>
      <td><kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>space</kbd></td>
      <td>0100000</td>
      <td>32</td>
      <td>Space</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>Null</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>?</kbd></td>
      <td>0111111</td>
      <td>63</td>
      <td>?</td>
      <td>1111111</td>
      <td>127</td>
      <td>Delete</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>
  One could argue that the first row shows a straightforward example
  of picking the least significiant five bits to arrive at the control
  code, so it is not really a special case.  That is a fair point.
  However, in the history of computing, different systems have
  implemented slightly different methods to compute the resulting
  control codes from our input.  Flipping the 7th least significant
  bit was one of the early methods.  Turning off only the the 6th and
  the 7th least significant bits has been another method.  Subtracting
  64 from the character code has been yet another one.  These
  different methods produce identical results for the first table but
  not so for the second table.  For example, while turning off the 6th
  and 7th least significnat bits of 32 (the code of the <em>space</em>
  character) does give us 0 but merely flipping its 7th bit does not.
  Further, note that allowing <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>space</kbd> to
  produce the null character is a bit redundant
  because <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>@</kbd> already did that right from the
  days of very early keyboards.  The second entry above is also a
  special rule because we neither turn off bits nor subtract 64.
  Instead, we flip the 7th least significant bit which amounts to
  adding 64 to the code of the modified character.  It is also the
  only control code that has its 6th and 7th least significant bits
  turned on.
</p>
<h2 id="meta-key-sequences">Meta Key Sequences</h2>
<p>
  The <kbd>meta</kbd> key no longer exists on modern keyboards.  On
  modern keyboards, we use the <kbd>alt</kbd> or <kbd>option</kbd> key
  instead of <kbd>meta</kbd>.  For example, when a shell's manual says
  that we need to type <kbd>meta</kbd>+<kbd>b</kbd> to move the cursor
  back by one word, what we really type on a modern keyboard is
  either <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>b</kbd>
  or <kbd>option</kbd>+<kbd>b</kbd>.  In fact, the <code>cat</code>
  and <code>od</code> experiments mentioned earlier show that when we
  type the modern alternative for the <kbd>meta</kbd> key along with
  another key, what most terminals really send to the underlying
  program is an <em>escape</em> control code (27) followed by the code
  of the modified character.

<p>
  There are several layers of software involved between the keyboard
  input and the application running in the terminal and the exact
  behaviour of the <kbd>alt</kbd> or <kbd>option</kbd> key may vary
  depending on the configuration of each of these layers.  Terminal
  configuration alone is a complex topic that can be discussed
  extensively.  However, the behaviour described here is one of the
  popular defaults.  Alternative behaviours exist but they generally
  produce similar effects for the user.
</p>
<h2 id="awkward-vim-tricks">Awkward Vim Tricks</h2>
<p>
  Most Vim users know that we can go from insert mode to command-line
  mode and search for patterns by typing
  either <kbd>esc</kbd> <kbd>/</kbd> or <kbd>C-[</kbd> <kbd>/</kbd>.
  But what some people may find surprising is that we can also go from
  insert mode to searching patterns simply by typing
  <kbd>meta</kbd>+<kbd>/</kbd>.  Yes, this can be verified by running
  Vim in a terminal emulator.  While insert mode is active,
  type <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>/</kbd> or <kbd>option</kbd>+<kbd>/</kbd>
  and the current mode should instantly switch to the command-line
  mode with the forward-slash (<samp>/</samp>) prompt waiting for our
  search pattern.  This works only in a terminal emulator.  It may not
  work in the graphical version of Vim.  The table above illustrates
  why this works in a terminal emulator.
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, in a Vim instance running within a terminal emulator, we
  can type <kbd>meta</kbd>+<kbd>:</kbd> to go directly from insert
  mode to command-line mode and enter Ex commands.  We can
  type <kbd>meta</kbd>+<kbd>0</kbd> to go directly from insert mode to
  the first character of a line, or type <kbd>meta</kbd>+<kbd>$</kbd>
  to go to the end of the line, and so on.  These are equivalent to
  typing <kbd>esc</kbd> <kbd>0</kbd>, <kbd>esc</kbd> <kbd>$</kbd>,
  etc.
</p>
<p>
  More interestingly, we can type <kbd>meta</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd> to open
  a line above, <kbd>meta</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> to append text at the end
  of the line, <kbd>meta</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> to append text at the
  beginning of the line, or <kbd>meta</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> to delete the
  current line while staying in insert mode!  Since the Vim
  commands <kbd>O</kbd>, <kbd>A</kbd>, <kbd>I</kbd>, and <kbd>S</kbd>
  leave us back in insert mode, we are able to perform an editing
  operation that involves leaving the insert mode, doing something
  interesting, and returning to insert mode instantly using the
  the <kbd>meta</kbd> key combination.  The following table summarises
  these observations:

  There is no good reason to use Vim like this but it works, thanks to
  the quirky history of Unix terminals and keyboards!
