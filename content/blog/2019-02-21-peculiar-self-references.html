<h2 id="self-referential-lists">Peculiar Results</h2>
<p>
  Here is a tiny Python example that creates a self-referential list
  and demonstrates the self-reference:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>a = a[0] = [0]</kbd>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>a</kbd>
[[...]]
&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>a[0]</kbd>
[[...]]
&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>a[0][0]</kbd>
[[...]]
&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>a is a[0]</kbd>
True</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  The output shows that <code>a[0]</code> refers to <code>a</code>
  itself which makes it a self-referential list. Why does this simple
  code create a self-referential list? Should it not have failed
  with <code>NameError</code> because <code>a</code> is not yet
  defined while assigning the list <code>[0]</code>
  to <code>a[0]</code>?
</p>
<p>
  Here is another similar example that creates a self-referential list
  too:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>a = a[0] = [0, 0]</kbd>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>a</kbd>
[[...], 0]</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  Here is a similar example for dictionary:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>a = a[0] = {}</kbd>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>a</kbd>
{0: {...}}</samp>
</pre>
<p>
   Note that <code>0</code> is used as a dictionary key in the above
  example. Here is another very simple example that uses a string key:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>a = a['k'] = {}</kbd>
&gt;&Gt;&gt; <kbd>a</kbd>
{'k': {...}}</samp>
</pre>
<h2 id="language-reference">The Language Reference</h2>
<p>
  My first guess was that the statement
</p>
<pre><code>a = a[0] = [0]</code></pre>
<p>
  behaves like
</p>
<pre>
<code>new = [0]
a = new
a[0] = new</code>
</pre>
<p>
  which would indeed create a self-referential list.

  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/reference/simple_stmts.html#assignment-statements">Section
  7.2 (Assignment statements)</a> of <em>The Python Language
  Reference</em> confirms this behaviour. Quoting the relevant part
  from this section here:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Assignment statements are used to (re)bind names to values and to
    modify attributes or items of mutable objects:
  </p>
  <pre>
<code>assignment_stmt ::=  (target_list "=")+ (starred_expression | yield_expression)
target_list     ::=  target ("," target)* [","]
target          ::=  identifier
                     | "(" [target_list] ")"
                     | "[" [target_list] "]"
                     | attributeref
                     | subscription
                     | slicing
                     | "*" target</code>
</pre>
  <p>
    (See
    section <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/reference/expressions.html#primaries">Primaries</a>
    for the syntax definitions for attributeref, subscription, and
    slicing.)
  </p>
  <p>
    An assignment statement evaluates the expression list (remember
    that this can be a single expression or a comma-separated list,
    the latter yielding a tuple) and assigns the single resulting
    object to each of the target lists, from left to right.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  We see that the assignment statement is defined as follows:
</p>
<pre><code>assignment_stmt ::=  (target_list "=")+ (starred_expression | yield_expression)</code></pre>
<p>
  Thus the statement
</p>
<pre><code>a = a[0] = [0]</code></pre>
<p>
  has two <code>target_list</code> elements (<code>a</code>
  and <code>a[0]</code>) and a <code>starred_expression</code> element
  (<code>[0]</code>). As a result, the same list on the
  right-hand-side is assigned to both <code>a</code>
  and <code>a[0]</code>, from left to right, i.e., the
  list <code>[0]</code> is first assigned to <code>a</code>,
  then <code>a[0]</code> is set to the <em>same</em> list. As a
  result, <code>a[0]</code> is set to <code>a</code> itself.
</p>
<p>
  The behaviour of the statement
</p>
<pre><code>a = a[0] = {}</code></pre>
<p>
  can be explained in a similar way. The dictionary object on the
  right-hand-side is first assigned to <code>a</code>. Then a
  key <code>0</code> is inserted within the <em>same</em> dictionary.
  Finally the value of <code>a[0]</code> is set to the <em>same</em>
  dictionary. In other words, <code>a[0]</code> is set
  to <code>a</code> itself.
</p>
<h2 id="more-experiments">More Experiments</h2>
<p>
  The evaluation of the expression list on the right hand side first
  and then assigning the result to each target list from left to right
  explains the behaviour we observed in the previous sections. This
  left-to-right assignment is quite uncommon among mainstream
  programming languages. For example, in C, C++, Java, and JavaScript
  the simple assignment operator (<code>=</code>) has right-to-left
  associativity. The left-to-right assignment in Python can be further
  demonstrated with some intentional errors. Here is an example:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>a[0] = a = [0]</kbd>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'a' is not defined</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  In this example, when the assignment to <code>a[0]</code> to occurs,
  the variable named <code>a</code> is not defined yet, so it leads
  to <code>NameError</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Here is another example:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>a = a[0] = 0</kbd>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'int' object does not support item assignment</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  In this example, <code>0</code> is first assigned to <code>a</code>.
  Then <code>a[0]</code> needs to be evaluated before <code>0</code>
  can be assigned to it but this evaluation fails
  because <code>a</code> is an <code>int</code>, a type that does not
  support
  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/reference/expressions.html#subscriptions">subscription</a>
  (also known as indexing), so it fails with <code>TypeError</code>.
