<!-- title: Shell Eval -->
<!-- tag: Shell Technology -->
<p>
  In this post, we will perform a few experiments to see the
  usefulness of the <code>eval</code> command for a particular
  scenario in a POSIX-compliant shell. At first, we prepare a test
  file that contains a space in its name and define a variable as
  follows:
</p>
<pre>
<code>$ <kbd>echo lorem ipsum &gt; "foo bar"</kbd>
$ <kbd>cmd='cat "foo bar"'</kbd></code>
</pre>
<p>
  We will use this file and the variable in the experiments below. All
  output examples below are obtained using Dash 0.5.11 on a Debian
  GNU/Linux 11.2 (bullseye) system. Dash stands for Debian Almquist
  Shell which is a POSIX-compliant shell available in Debian. Any
  POSIX conforming shell should produce similar output. On Zsh, use
  the command <code>emulate sh</code> before running these examples to
  get similar output.

<p>
  Now simply enter <code>$cmd</code> as a command into the shell. The
  following error occurs:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>$cmd</kbd>
cat: '"foo': No such file or directory
cat: 'bar"': No such file or directory</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  The error occurs because the above command expands to the
  command <code>cat</code> followed by two
  arguments: <code>"foo</code> and <code>bar"</code>. Such an
  expansion occurs due to a concept known as field splitting. Quoting
  from section 2.6.5
  of <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/">POSIX.1-2017</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    After parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic
    expansion, the shell shall scan the results of expansions and
    substitutions that did not occur in double-quotes for field
    splitting and multiple fields can result.
  </p>
  <p>
    The shell shall treat each character of the IFS as a delimiter and
    use the delimiters as field terminators to split the results of
    parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion
    into fields.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  By default, the space character belongs to <code>IFS</code>. Here is
  an example command to verify this:
</p>
<pre>
<code>$ <kbd>printf "$IFS" | od -tcx1</kbd>
0000000      \t  \n
         20  09  0a
0000003</code>
</pre>
<p>
  The hexadecimal code <code>20</code> in the output confirms that the
  space character is present in the value of <code>IFS</code>.
  Therefore, as per the POSIX specification, <code>$cmd</code> first
  expands to <code>cat "foo bar"</code>, then it is split into three
  fields <code>cat</code>, <code>"foo</code>, and <code>bar"</code>,
  and then the command <code>cat</code> is executed with two
  arguments <code>"foo</code> and <code>bar"</code>. Since no files
  with those names exist, an error occurs.
</p>

<p>
  Next we try to double-quote the previous command to prevent field
  splitting and see what happens:
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>"$cmd"</kbd>
dash: 8: cat "foo bar": not found</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  The excerpt from the POSIX.1-2017 specification quoted in the
  previous section shows that field splitting does not for occur
  variable expansions within double quotes. So the entire
  expansion <code>cat "foo bar"</code> remains intact as a single
  field and is then executed as a command. Since there is no such
  weirdly named command, we get the above error.
</p>

<p>
  Field splitting leads to an error as seen in the first experiment.
  Preventing field splitting by double-quoting the variable expansion
  also leads to an error as seen in the second experiment. How do we
  execute the command in the <code>cmd</code> variable?
</p>
<p>
  We need a way to somehow get the shell to parse <code>cat "foo
  bar"</code> like a shell normally does, i.e., treat each unquoted
  token as a separate field and each quoted token as a single one. How
  do we get the shell to do that? Well, we can just invoke the shell
  itself to parse our command:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>sh -c "$cmd"</kbd>
lorem ipsum</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  But the above command invokes a new shell process. Can we avoid
  that? Yes, using the <code>eval</code> command:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>eval "$cmd"</kbd>
lorem ipsum</samp>
</pre>
