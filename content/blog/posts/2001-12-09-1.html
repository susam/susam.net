  What is the difference between \( 0.999\ldots \) and \( 1? \) Note
  that the ellipsis denotes a never-ending sequence of 9s. Is the
  difference a small but positive real number? If so, what is that
  number? Or is the difference simply \( 0? \) It turns out that the
  difference is indeed \( 0. \) In fact, we can write

  \[
  1 - 0.999\ldots = 0.
  \]

  Intuitively, it may feel like the number \( 0.999\ldots \) gets
  closer and closer to \( 1 \) without ever reaching \( 1 \), however,
  such a feeling is misleading. When analyzed rigorously, we find that

  \[
  0.999\ldots = 1.
  \]

  Both numbers are exactly equal and their difference is exactly \( 0
  \).

  Before we get into a proper proof, it might be worthwhile
  demonstrating the equality above algebraically.

  Let us first write

  \[
  0.333\ldots = \frac{1}{3}.
  \]

  Multiplying both sides by \( 3 \), we get

  \[
  0.999\ldots = 1.
  \]

  That was quite straightforward but not rigorous. We will discuss
  more about it in a moment.

  Let us see another similar demonstration. We let \( x = 0.999\dots
  \) and obtain

  \[
  10x = 9.999\dots = 9 + 0.999\dots = 9 + x.
  \]

  Subtracting \( x \) from both sides, we get

  \[
  9x = 9.
  \]

  Dividing both sides by \( 9 \), we get

  \[
  x = 1.
  \]

  Thus \( 0.999\dots = 1. \)
  The above equation can be rewritten as

  \[
  10 \times 0.999\ldots = 0.999\ldots + 9.
  \]

  Now it is worth noting here that these algebraic demonstrations are
  not rigorous proofs because we have not shown that elementary rules
  for addition and multiplication extend to repeating decimal numbers
  too. They do but we have not demonstrated that here. However, this
  is a good start to challenge any faulty intuition that might have
  led one to doubt the above equality. While there are many ways to
  prove this equality, one easy way is to rely on the formula for the
  infinite geometric series which has a sound basis in real analysis.

  From the study of real analysis, we know that

  \[
  a + ar + ar^2 + \dots = \frac{a}{1 - r}
  \]

  where \( a \) and \( r \) are real numbers and \( \lvert r \rvert
  &lt; 1. \) Now let \( a = 9/10 \) and \( r = 1/10 \) to get

  \[
  \frac{9}{10} + \frac{9}{100} + \dots = \frac{\frac{9}{10}}{1 - \frac{1}{10}}.
  \]

  The LHS is \( 0.999\ldots \) and the RHS is \( 1 \), so we get

  \[
  0.999\ldots = 1.
  \]

  Now one might argue that here too we did not prove the formula for
  geometric series. That is true but the point of this post is not to
  establish the basic theorems of real analysis but instead to show
  that we can use known theorems to convince ourselves beyond any
  doubt that \( 0.999\dots \) is indeed exactly equal to \( 1. \)
  Relying on the formula for geometric series provides us a convenient
  starting point without compromising on rigour. In particular, this
  analytic proof depends on the convergence of the geometric series
  when \( \lvert r \rvert &lt; 1 \) the proof of which can be found in
  any introductory book on real analysis. There are several other
  proofs too but this is one of the very approachable ones.
