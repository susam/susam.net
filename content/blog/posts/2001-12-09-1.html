  What is the difference between \( 0.999\ldots \) and \( 1?  \) Note
  that the ellipsis denotes a never-ending sequence of 9s.  Is the
  difference a small but positive real number?  If so, what is that
  number?  Or is the difference simply \( 0?  \) It turns out that the
  difference is indeed \( 0.  \) In fact, we can write

  \[ 1 - 0.999\ldots = 0.  \]

  Intuitively, it may feel like the number \( 0.999\ldots \) gets
  closer and closer to \( 1 \) without ever reaching \( 1.  \) When
  analyzed rigorously, we find that

  \[ 0.999\ldots = 1.  \]

  Both numbers are exactly equal and their difference is exactly
  \( 0. \)

  Before we get into a proper proof, it might be worthwhile
  demonstrating the equality above algebraically.
</p>
<p>
  Let us first write

  \[ 0.333\ldots = \frac{1}{3}.  \]

  Multiplying both sides by \( 3, \) we get

  \[ 0.999\ldots = 1.  \]

  That was quite straightforward but not rigorous.  We will discuss
  more about it in a moment.

<p>
  Let us see another similar demonstration.  We let \( x = 0.999\ldots
  \) and obtain

  \[ 10x = 9.999\ldots = 9 + 0.999\ldots = 9 + x.  \]

  Subtracting \( x \) from both sides, we get

  \[ 9x = 9.  \]

  Dividing both sides by \( 9, \) we get

  \[ x = 1.  \]

  Thus \( 0.999\ldots = 1.  \)

  Now it is worth noting here that these algebraic demonstrations are
  not rigorous proofs because we have not shown that elementary rules
  for addition and multiplication extend to repeating decimal numbers
  too.  They do but we have not demonstrated that here.  However, this
  is a good start to challenge any faulty intuition that might have
  led one to doubt the above equality.  While there are many ways to
  prove this equality, one easy way is to rely on the formula for the
  infinite geometric series which has a sound basis in real analysis.

<h2 id="infinite-geometric-series">Infinite Geometric Series</h2>
<p>
  Let us denote \( 0.999\ldots \) as

  \[ 0.999\ldots = \frac{9}{10} + \frac{9}{100} + \frac{9}{1000} + \ldots \]

  Note that the RHS is an infinite geometric series.  From the study
  of real analysis, we know that

  \[ a + ar + ar^2 + \dots = \frac{a}{1 - r} \]

  where \( a \) and \( r \) are real numbers and \( \lvert r \rvert
  &lt; 1.  \) Now let \( a = 9/10 \) and \( r = 1/10 \) to get

  \[
    \frac{9}{10} + \frac{9}{100} + \frac{9}{1000} + \dots
    = \frac{\frac{9}{10}}{1 - \frac{1}{10}}.
  \]

  The LHS is \( 0.999\ldots \) and the RHS is \( 1, \) so we get

  \[ 0.999\ldots = 1.  \]

  Now one might argue that here too we did not prove the formula for
  geometric series.  That is true but the point of this article is not
  to establish the basic theorems of real analysis but instead to show
  that we can use known theorems to convince ourselves beyond any
  doubt that \( 0.999\ldots \) is indeed exactly equal to \( 1.  \)
  Relying on the formula for geometric series provides us a convenient
  starting point without compromising on rigour.  In particular, this
  analytic proof depends on the convergence of the geometric series
  when \( \lvert r \rvert &lt; 1.  \) The proof of convergence can be
  found in any introductory book on real analysis.

<p>
  In this section, we will take a close look at the LHS above.  The
  LHS seems to have a sum of an infinite number of terms but we cannot
  literally add infinite terms together, can we?  What does the LHS
  mean then?
</p>
<p>
  Adding infinite number of terms is not a valid operation.  Infinity
  is not a <em>number</em>.  It is a <em>notion</em>, a notion that we
  can better understand, in this context, using limits.  When we write

  \[ \frac{9}{10} + \frac{9}{100} + \frac{9}{1000} + \dots = 1 \]

  what we really mean can be expressed formally as follows:

  \[ \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{9}{10^k} = 1.  \]

  By the definition of limit of sequence, what the above equation
  means is that for every real \( \epsilon &gt; 0, \) there exists a
  positive integer \( N \) such that for all \( n \ge N, \) we have

  \[ \left\lvert 1 - \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{9}{10^k} \right\rvert &lt; \epsilon.  \]

  In simpler words, we can say that no matter how small a positive
  real number we choose for \( \epsilon, \) we can find large enough
  threshold for \( n \) such that for all values of \( n \) equal to
  or above that threshold, the difference between \( 1 \) and \(
  \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{9}{10^k} \) becomes smaller than \( \epsilon.  \)
  To summarize, we have shown using the definition of limit of a
  sequence that

  \[ 0.999\ldots = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{9}{10^k} = 1.  \]

  This is one of several ways to show that \( 0.999\ldots = 1.  \)
  There are several other proofs too but this is one of the very
  approachable ones.
