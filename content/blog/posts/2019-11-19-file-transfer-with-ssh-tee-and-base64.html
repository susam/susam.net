<!-- title: File Transfer with SSH, Tee, and Base64 -->
<!-- tag: Networking Protocol Technology -->

<p>
  Computer servers deployed in a secure environment may allow SSH sessions
  but forbid SCP, SFTP, and execution of remote commands without a login
  shell. Such restricted access is typically enforced with SSH gateways
  and firewalls. An SSH gateway provides controlled access to the remote
  system. A firewall can ensure that only an SSH gateway can connect to
  the remote system. Thus, users can be forced to connect to the remote
  system only via the SSH gateway which can now control what is allowed
  and what isn't.
</p>

<p>
  Even if SCP, SFTP, port forwarding, and remote command execution
  without a login shell are forbidden, as long as we get a login shell
  on our terminal and we can print data on the terminal, we are already
  able to transfer data from the remote system to our local system. The
  data is in the terminal. It is now only a matter of figuring out how
  to copy that data to a file.

    <strong>Note:</strong> Various readers of this post notice that
    SCP or SFTP is not allowed and immediately begin suggesting me a
    solution similar to one of the following ones:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>ssh HOST cat file > file</code></li>
    <li><code>ssh HOST tar cf - file | tar xf -</code></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Note that these solutions and other similar solutions are not
    going to work because the SSH gateway described in the previous
    two paragraphs forbids remote command execution without a login
    shell. It also blocks port forwarding, so any solution involving
    port forwarding is not going to work either.

  Assuming that both the remote and local systems are Unix-like, the
  following steps show one way to accomplish copying a file from the
  remote system to our local system:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Connect to the remote system with <code>ssh</code> and pipe the
      output to <code>tee</code> to write the entire session to a text
      file on the local system.
    </p>
    <pre><code>ssh HOST | tee ssh.txt</code></pre>
    <p>
      This type of pipeline works as intended even while connecting to a
      remote system via a jumphost or an SSH gateway.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      In the remote system, create a 10 MB file to serve as an example
      payload to be transferred.
    </p>
    <pre><code>head -c 10485760 /dev/urandom &gt; /tmp/payload</code></pre>
    <p>
      You probably already have a meaningful payload that you want to
      copy, so in that case, you would skip this step.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Compute checksum on the file. This will be used later to verify
      that the entire file is transferred correctly.
    </p>
    <pre><code>sha1sum /tmp/payload</code></pre>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Print Base64 representation of the file.
    </p>
    <pre><code>base64 /tmp/payload</code></pre>
    <p>
      Depending on the Internet bandwidth, this can take a few seconds
      to a few minutes to complete.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      End the SSH session.
    </p>
    <pre><code>exit</code></pre>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      On the local system, extract the Base64 encoded payload and decode
      it. Assuming the shell prompt on the remote system ends with the
      dollar sign (i.e., <code>$</code>), the following command does
      this.
    </p>
    <pre><code>sed '1,/$ base64/d;/$ exit/,$d' ssh.txt | base64 --decode &gt; payload</code></pre>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Extract the checksum computed on the original file.
    </p>
    <pre><code>grep -A 1 sha1sum ssh.txt</code></pre>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Compute checksum on the decoded payload.
    </p>
    <pre><code>sha1sum payload</code></pre>
    <p>
      Ensure that the checksum in this step matches the checksum in the
      previous step.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  The steps above assume the use of the <code>sha1sum</code> command to
  compute checksum. If this command is unavailable, use
  <code>sha1</code>, <code>shasum</code>, or something else that serves
  this purpose well. If you are worried about collision attacks, you
  might want <code>sha256sum</code>, <code>sha256</code>, <code>shasum
    -a 256</code>, etc. instead.
