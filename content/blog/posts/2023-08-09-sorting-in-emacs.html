<!-- title: Sorting in Emacs -->
<!-- tag: Emacs Technology -->
<p>
  In this post, we will look at some hands-on experiments that
  demonstrate the various Emacs commands that can be used to sort
  lines in different ways.  Of course, all the sorting commands are
  described pretty well in the Emacs and Elisp manuals.  Here, we are
  going to focus on a subset of those commands and present some
  concrete examples to illustrate how they work.
</p>
<ol>
  <li> <!-- 1. Create buffer -->
    <p>
      First create a buffer that has the following text:
    </p>
<pre>
<code>Carol  200  London  LHR->SFO
Dan    20   Tokyo   HND->LHR
Bob    100  London  LCY->CDG
Alice  10   Paris   CDG->LHR
Bob    30   Paris   ORY->HND</code>
</pre>
    <p>
      Let us pretend that each line is a record that represents some
      details about different persons.  From left to right, we have
      each person's name, some sort of numerical ID, their current
      location, and their upcoming travel plan.  For example, the
      first line says that Carol from London is planning to travel
      from London Heathrow (LHR) to San Francisco (SFO).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li> <!-- 2. sort-lines -->
    <p>
      Type <code>C-x h</code> to mark the whole buffer and
      type <code>M-x sort-lines RET</code> to sort lines
      alphabetically.  The buffer looks like this now:
    </p>
<pre>
<code>Alice  10   Paris   CDG->LHR
Bob    100  London  LCY->CDG
Bob    30   Paris   ORY->HND
Carol  200  London  LHR->SFO
Dan    20   Tokyo   HND->LHR</code>
</pre>
  </li>
  <li> <!-- 3. sort-lines (reverse) -->
    <p>
      Type <code>C-x h</code> followed by <code>C-u M-x sort-lines
      RET</code> to reverse sort lines alphabetically.  The key
      sequence <code>C-u</code> specifies a prefix argument that
      indicates that a reverse sort must be performed.  The buffer
      looks like this now:
    </p>
<pre>
<code>Dan    20   Tokyo   HND->LHR
Carol  200  London  LHR->SFO
Bob    30   Paris   ORY->HND
Bob    100  London  LCY->CDG
Alice  10   Paris   CDG->LHR</code>
</pre>
  </li>
  <li> <!-- 4. sort-fields (first) -->
    <p>
      Type <code>C-x h</code> followed by <code>M-x sort-fields
      RET</code> to sort the lines by the first field only.  Fields
      are separated by whitespace.  Note that the result now is
      slightly different from the result of <code>M-x sort-lines
      RET</code> presented in point 2 earlier.  Here Bob from Paris
      comes before Bob from London because the sorting was performed
      by the first field only.  The sorting algorithm ignored the rest
      of each line.  However in point 2 earlier, Bob from London came
      before Bob from Paris because the sorting was performed by
      entire lines.
    </p>
<pre>
<code>Alice  10   Paris   CDG->LHR
Bob    30   Paris   ORY->HND
Bob    100  London  LCY->CDG
Carol  200  London  LHR->SFO
Dan    20   Tokyo   HND->LHR</code>
</pre>
  </li>
  <li> <!-- 5. sort-fields (second) -->
    <p>
      Type <code>C-x h</code> followed by <code>M-2 M-x sort-fields
      RET</code> to sort the lines alphabetically by the second field.
      The key sequence <code>M-2</code> here specifies a numeric
      argument that identifies the field we want to sort by.  Note
      that <code>100</code> comes before <code>20</code> because we
      performed an alphabetical sort, not numerical sort.  The result
      looks like this:
    </p>
<pre>
<code>Alice  10   Paris   CDG->LHR
Bob    100  London  LCY->CDG
Dan    20   Tokyo   HND->LHR
Carol  200  London  LHR->SFO
Bob    30   Paris   ORY->HND</code>
</pre>
  </li>
  <li> <!-- 6. sort-numeric-fields -->
    <p>
      Type <code>C-x h</code> followed by <code>M-2 M-x
      sort-numeric-fields RET</code> to sort the lines numerically by
      the second field.  The result looks like this:
    </p>
<pre>
<code>Alice  10   Paris   CDG->LHR
Dan    20   Tokyo   HND->LHR
Bob    30   Paris   ORY->HND
Bob    100  London  LCY->CDG
Carol  200  London  LHR->SFO</code>
</pre>
  </li>
  <li> <!-- 7. sort-fields (third) -->
    <p>
      Type <code>C-x h</code> followed by <code>M-3 M-x sort-fields
      RET</code> to sort the lines alphabetically by the third field
      containing city names.  The result looks like this:
    </p>
<pre>
<code>Bob    100  London  LCY->CDG
Carol  200  London  LHR->SFO
Alice  10   Paris   CDG->LHR
Bob    30   Paris   ORY->HND
Dan    20   Tokyo   HND->LHR</code>
</pre>
    <p>
      Note that we cannot supply the prefix argument <code>C-u</code>
      to this command to perform a reverse sort by a specific field
      because the prefix argument here is used to identify the field
      we need to sort by.  If we do specify the prefix
      argument <code>C-u</code>, it would be treated as the numeric
      argument <code>4</code> which would sort the lines by the fourth
      field.  However, there is a little trick to reverse sort lines
      by a specific field.  The next point shows this.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li> <!-- 8. reverse-region -->
    <p>
      Type <code>C-x h</code> followed by <code>M-x reverse-region
      RET</code>.  This reverses the order of lines in the region.
      Combined with the previous command, this effectively
      reverse sorts the lines by city names.  The result looks like
      this:
    </p>
<pre>
<code>Dan    20   Tokyo   HND->LHR
Bob    30   Paris   ORY->HND
Alice  10   Paris   CDG->LHR
Carol  200  London  LHR->SFO
Bob    100  London  LCY->CDG</code>
</pre>
  </li>
  <li> <!-- 9. sort-fields (negative) -->
    <p>
      Type <code>C-x h</code> followed by <code>M-- M-2 M-x
      sort-fields RET</code> to sort the lines alphabetically by the
      second field from the right (the third field).  Note that the
      first two key combinations are <kbd>meta</kbd>+<kbd>-</kbd>
      and <kbd>meta</kbd>+<kbd>2</kbd>.  They specify a negative
      argument <code>-2</code> to sort the lines by the second field
      from the right.  The result looks like this:
    </p>
<pre>
<code>Carol  200  London  LHR->SFO
Bob    100  London  LCY->CDG
Bob    30   Paris   ORY->HND
Alice  10   Paris   CDG->LHR
Dan    20   Tokyo   HND->LHR</code>
</pre>
  </li>
  <li> <!-- 10. sort-columns -->
    <p>
      Type <code>M-&lt;</code> to move the point to the beginning of
      the buffer.  Then type <code>C-s London RET</code> followed
      by <code>M-b</code> to move the point to the beginning of the
      word <code>London</code> on the first line.  Now
      type <code>C-SPC</code> to set a mark there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then type <code>C-4 C-n C-e</code> to move the point to the end
      of the last line.  An active region should be visible in the
      buffer now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally type <code>M-x sort-columns RET</code> to sort the
      columns bounded by the column positions of mark and point (i.e.,
      the last two columns).  The result looks like this:
    </p>
<pre>
<code>Bob    100  London  LCY->CDG
Carol  200  London  LHR->SFO
Alice  10   Paris   CDG->LHR
Bob    30   Paris   ORY->HND
Dan    20   Tokyo   HND->LHR</code>
</pre>
  </li>
  <li> <!-- 11. sort-columns (reverse) -->
    <p>
      Like before, type <code>M-&lt;</code> to move the point to the
      beginning of the buffer.  Then type <code>C-s London RET</code>
      followed by <code>M-b</code> to move the point to the beginning
      of the word <code>London</code> on the first line.  Now
      type <code>C-SPC</code> to set a mark there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, like before, type <code>C-4 C-n C-e</code> to move the
      point to the end of the last line.  An active region should be
      visible in the buffer now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now type <code>C-u M-x sort-columns RET</code> to reverse sort
      the last two columns.
    </p>
<pre>
<code>Dan    20   Tokyo   HND->LHR
Bob    30   Paris   ORY->HND
Alice  10   Paris   CDG->LHR
Carol  200  London  LHR->SFO
Bob    100  London  LCY->CDG</code>
</pre>
  </li>
  <li> <!-- 12. sort-regexp-fields (warning) -->
    <p>
      Warning: This step shows how <em>not to</em> use
      the <code>sort-regexp-fields</code> command.  In most cases you
      probably do not want to do this.  The next point shows a typical
      usage of this command that is correct in most cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Type <code>C-x h</code> followed by <code>M-x sort-regexp-fields
      RET [A-Z]*-&gt;\(.*\) RET \1 RET</code> to sort by the
      destination airport.  This command first matches the destination
      aiport in each line in a regular expression capturing group
      (<code>\(.*\)</code>).  Then we ask this command to sort the
      lines by the field matched by this capturing group
      (<code>\1</code>).  The result looks like this:
    </p>
<pre>
<code>Dan    20   Tokyo   LCY->CDG
Bob    30   Paris   ORY->HND
Alice  10   Paris   HND->LHR
Carol  200  London  CDG->LHR
Bob    100  London  LHR->SFO</code>
</pre>
    <p>
      Observe how all our travel records are messed up in this result.
      Now Dan from Tokyo is travelling from LCY to CDG instead of
      travelling from HND to LHR.  Compare the results in this point
      with that of the previous point.  This command has sorted the
      destination fields fine and it has maintained the association
      between the source airport and destination airport fine too.
      But the association between the other fields (first three
      columns) and the last field (source and destination airports) is
      broken.  This happened because the regular expression matches
      only the last column and we sorted by only the destination field
      of the last column, so the association of the fields in the last
      column is kept intact but the rest of the association is broken.
      Only the part of each line that is matched by the regular
      expression moves around while the sorting is performed;
      everything else remains unchanged.  This behaviour may be useful
      in some limited situations but in most cases, we want to keep
      the association between all the fields intact.  The next point
      shows how to do this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now type <code>C-/</code> (or <code>C-x u</code>) to undo this
      change and revert the buffer to the previous good state.  After
      doing this, the buffer should look like the result presented in
      the previous point.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li> <!-- 13. sort-regexp-fields (correct) -->
    <p>
      Assuming the state of the buffer is same as that of the result
      in point 11, we will now see how to alter the previous step such
      that when we sort the lines by the destination field, the entire
      lines move along with the destination fields.  The trick is to
      ensure that the regular expression matches entire lines.  To do
      so, we make a minor change in the regular expression.
      Type <code>C-x h</code> followed by <code>M-x sort-regexp-fields
      RET .*-&gt;\(.*\) RET \1 RET</code>.
    </p>
<pre>
<code>Bob    100  London  LCY->CDG
Bob    30   Paris   ORY->HND
Dan    20   Tokyo   HND->LHR
Alice  10   Paris   CDG->LHR
Carol  200  London  LHR->SFO</code>
</pre>
    <p>
      Now the lines are sorted by the destination field and Dan from
      Tokyo is travelling from HND to LHR.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li> <!-- 14. sort-regexp-fields (reverse) -->
    <p>
      Type <code>C-x h</code> followed by <code>M-- M-x
      sort-regexp-fields RET .*-&gt;\(.*\) RET \1 RET</code> to
      reverse sort the lines by the destination airport.  Note that
      the first key combination is <kbd>meta</kbd>+<kbd>-</kbd> here.
      This key combination specifies a negative argument that results
      in a reverse sort.  The result looks like this:
    </p>
<pre>
<code>Carol  200  London  LHR->SFO
Dan    20   Tokyo   HND->LHR
Alice  10   Paris   CDG->LHR
Bob    30   Paris   ORY->HND
Bob    100  London  LCY->CDG</code>
</pre>
  </li>
  <li> <!-- 15. shell-command-on-region -->
    <p>
      Finally, note that we can always invoke shell commands on a
      region and replace the region with the output of the shell
      command.  To see this in action, first prepare the buffer by
      typing <code>M-&lt;</code> followed by <code>C-k C-k C-y
      C-y</code> to duplicate the first line of the buffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then type <code>C-x h</code> followed by <code>C-u M-| sort
      -u</code> to sort the lines but remove duplicate lines during
      the sort operation.  The <code>M-|</code> key sequence invokes
      the command <code>shell-command-on-region</code> which prompts
      for a shell command, executes it, and usually displays the
      output in the echo area.  If the output cannot fit in the echo
      area, then it displays the output in a separate buffer.
      However, if a prefix argument is supplied, say
      with <code>C-u</code>, then it replaces the region with the
      output.  As a result, the buffer now looks like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
<code>Alice  10   Paris   CDG->LHR
Bob    100  London  LCY->CDG
Bob    30   Paris   ORY->HND
Carol  200  London  LHR->SFO
Dan    20   Tokyo   HND->LHR</code>
</pre>
    <p>
      This particular problem of removing duplicates while sorting can
      be also be accomplished by typing <code>C-x h</code> followed
      by <code>M-x sort-lines RET</code> and then <code>C-x h</code>
      followed by <code>M-x delete-duplicate-lines</code>.
      Nevertheless, it is useful to know that we can execute arbitrary
      shell commands on a region.

  Further, the documentation strings for these commands have useful
  information too.  Use the key sequence <code>C-h f</code> to look up
  the documentation strings.  For example, type <code>C-h f
  sort-regexp-fields RET</code> to look up the documentation string
  for the <code>sort-regexp-fields</code> command.
