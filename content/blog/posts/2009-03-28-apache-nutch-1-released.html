<!-- tag: Technology -->
<p>
  Today, we received
  <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/nutch-dev@lucene.apache.org/msg09511.html">an
    announcement</a> from the Nutch committer,
  <a href="http://people.apache.org/%7Esiren/">Sami Siren</a> that
  <a href="http://nutch.apache.org/">Apache Nutch</a> 1.0 has been
  released. An extract from the announcement:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Apache Nutch, a subproject of Apache Lucene, is open source
    web-search software. It builds on Lucene Java, adding
    web-specifics, such as a crawler, a link-graph database, parsers
    for HTML and other document formats.
  </p>
  <p>
    Apache Nutch 1.0 contains a number of bug fixes and improvements
    such as Solr Integration, new indexing framework and new scoring
    framework just to mention a few. Details can be found in the
    changes file:

  I have been waiting for this release for a long time as I made some
  contributions to this project and I wanted them to be available in
  official release so that I didn't have to maintain a separate set of
  patches for myself. These contributions were also my first major
  contributions to an open source project. Let me list my
  contributions from
  the <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/nutch/tags/release-1.0/CHANGES.txt">CHANGES.txt</a>
  file and then describe how I got involved in this project.
</p>
<pre>
<code>62. NUTCH-559 - NTLM, Basic and Digest Authentication schemes for web/proxy
    server. (Susam Pal via dogacan)

77. NUTCH-44 - Too many search results, limits max results returned from a
    single search. (Emilijan Mirceski and Susam Pal via kubes)

80. NUTCH-612 - URL filtering was disabled in Generator when invoked
    from Crawl (Susam Pal via ab)

81. NUTCH-601 - Recrawling on existing crawl directory (Susam Pal via ab)</code>
</pre>
<p>
  In 2007, while playing with the search engine, I found that there
  was no way for Nutch to authenticate itself to intranet sites
  requiring HTTP authentication. I modified the module that deals with
  the HTTP protocol so that it could authenticate itself with
  configured credentials when challenged with authentication. With
  this change, Nutch now supports NTLM, Basic and Digest
  authentication schemes. More details on this can be found on the
  Nutch JIRA at
  <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NUTCH-559">NUTCH-559</a>.
  and at the Nutch Wiki entry
  on <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/nutch/HttpAuthenticationSchemes">HTTP
  authentication schemes</a>.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NUTCH-44">NUTCH-44</a>
  and <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NUTCH-612">NUTCH-612</a>
  were bug
  fixes. <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NUTCH-601">NUTCH-601</a>
  now allows Nutch to perform deeper crawls using a live index. In the
  days of Nutch 0.9, the crawler complained if a directory with the
  name 'crawl' already existed in the current directory. As a result,
  before beginning a re-crawl using the <code>bin/nutch crawl</code>
  command, we had to move the existing crawl directory to another
  location. After a discussion in the community, we agreed that it was
  better to avoid shuffling the crawl directories by allowing
  re-crawls on the same directory.
</p>
<p>
  Nutch users' mailing list has often received emails from users who
  wanted to know how they could enable support for authentication
  schemes in Nutch 0.9 by applying the
  <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12370428/NUTCH-559v0.5.patch">NUTCH-559
    patch</a>. Patching Nutch 0.9 was a little cumbersome as the patch
  was generated against the trunk. With this release, the users can
  now simply download Nutch 1.0 and configure the authentication
  schemes.
