  A particular type of question comes up often in C programming
  forums. Here is an example of such a question:
</p>
<pre>
<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
    int i = 5;
    printf("%d %d %d\n", i, i--, ++i);
    return 0;
}</code>
</pre>
<p>
  The output is <code>5 6 5</code> when compiled with GCC and
  <code>6 6 6</code> when compiled with the C compiler that comes with
  Microsoft Visual Studio. The versions of the compilers with which I
  got these results are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    gcc (Debian 4.3.2-1.1) 4.3.2
  </li>
  <li>
    Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 32-Bit C/C++ Optimizing Compiler
    Version 14.00.50727.42 for 80x86
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Here is another example of such a question:
</p>
<pre>
<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
    int a = 5;
    a += a++ + a++;
    printf("%d\n", a);
    return 0;
}</code>
</pre>
<p>
  In this case, I got the output <code>17</code> with both the
  compilers.
</p>
<p>
  The behaviour of such C programs is undefined. Consider the
  following two statements:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>printf("%d %d %d\n", i, i--, ++i);</code></li>
  <li><code>a += a++ + a++;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>
  We will see below that in both the statements, the variable is
  modified twice between two consecutive sequence points. If the value
  of a variable is modified more than once between two consecutive
  sequence points, the behaviour is undefined. Such code may behave
  differently when compiled with different compilers.

  Before looking at the relevant sections of the C99 standard, let us
  see what the book
  <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language_(book)">The C Programming Language</a></em>,
  Second Edition says about such C statements. In Section 2.12
  (Precedence and Order of Evaluation) of the book, the authors write:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    C, like most languages, does not specify the order in which the
    operands of an operator are evaluated. (The exceptions are
    <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code>, <code>?:</code>, and
    '<code>,</code>'.) For example, in a statement like
  </p>
  <pre><code>x = f() + g();</code></pre>
  <p>
    <code>f</code> may be evaluated before <code>g</code> or vice
    versa; thus if either <code>f</code> or <code>g</code> alters a
    variable on which the other depends, <code>x</code> can depend on
    the order of evaluation. Intermediate results can be stored in
    temporary variables to ensure a particular sequence.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  In the next paragraph, they write,
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Similarly, the order in which function arguments are evaluated is
    not specified, so the statement
  </p>
  <pre><code>printf("%d %d\n", ++n, power(2, n));    /* WRONG */</code></pre>
  <p>
    can produce different results with different compilers, depending
    on whether <code>n</code> is incremented before <code>power</code>
    is called. The solution, of course, is to write
  </p>
<pre>
<code>++n;
printf("%d %d\n", n, power(2, n));</code>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
  They provide one more example in this section:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    One unhappy situation is typified by the statement
  </p>
<pre>
<code>a[i] = i++;</code>
</pre>
  <p>
    The question is whether the subscript is the old value
    of <code>i</code> or the new. Compilers can interpret this in
    different ways, and generate different answers depending on their
    interpretation.
  </p>

  To read more about this, download the
  <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1256.pdf">C99
    standard</a>, go to section 5.1.2.3 (Program execution), and see the
  second point which mentions:
</p>
<blockquote>
  Accessing a volatile object, modifying an object, modifying a file,
  or calling a function that does any of those operations are
  all <em>side effects</em>,<sup>11)</sup> which are changes in the
  state of the execution environment. Evaluation of an expression may
  produce side effects. At certain specified points in the execution
  sequence called <em>sequence points</em>, all side effects of
  previous evaluations shall be complete and no side effects of
  subsequent evaluations shall have taken place. (A summary of the
  sequence points is given in annex C.)
</blockquote>
<p>
  Then go to section 6.5 and see the second point which mentions:
</p>
<blockquote>
  Between the previous and next sequence point an object shall have
  its stored value modified at most once by the evaluation of an
  expression.<sup>72)</sup> Furthermore, the prior value shall be read
  only to determine the value to be stored.<sup>73)</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Finally go to Annex C (Sequence Points). It lists all the sequence
  points. For example, the following is mentioned as a sequence point:
</p>
<blockquote>
  The call to a function, after the arguments have been evaluated
  (6.5.2.2).
</blockquote>
<p>
  This means that in the statement
</p>
<pre><code>printf("%d %d %d\n", i, i--, ++i);</code></pre>
<p>
  there is a sequence point after the evaluation of the three
  arguments (<code>i</code>, <code>i--</code>, and <code>++i</code>)
  and before the <code>printf()</code> function is called. But none of
  the items specified in Annex C implies that there is a sequence
  point between the evaluation of the arguments. Yet the value
  of <code>i</code> is modified more than once during the evaluation
  of these arguments. This makes the behaviour of this statement
  undefined. Further, the value of <code>i</code> is being read not
  only for determining what it must be updated to but also for using
  as arguments to the <code>printf()</code> call. This also makes the
  behaviour of this code undefined.
</p>
<p>
  Let us see another example of a sequence point from Annex C.
</p>
<blockquote>
  The end of a full expression: an initializer (6.7.8); the expression
  in an expression statement (6.8.3); the controlling expression of a
  selection statement (<code>if</code> or <code>switch</code>)
  (6.8.4); the controlling expression of a <code>while</code>
  or <code>do</code> statement (6.8.5); each of the expressions of
  a <code>for</code> statement (6.8.5.3); the expression in
  a <code>return</code> statement (6.8.6.4).
</blockquote>
<p>
  Therefore in the statement
</p>
<pre><code>a += a++ + a++;</code></pre>
<p>
  there is a sequence point at the end of the complete expression
  (marked with a semicolon) but there is no other sequence point
  before it. Yet the value of <code>a</code> is modified twice before
  the sequence point. Thus the behaviour of this statement is
  undefined.
