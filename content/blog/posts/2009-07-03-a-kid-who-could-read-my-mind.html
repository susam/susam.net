<!-- title: A Kid Who Could Read My Mind -->
<!-- tag: Miscellaneous -->
<p>
  Last night, I found myself in the midst of a peculiar group of
  strangers. Among them was a mysterious kid who made an astonishing
  claim&mdash;he possessed the ability to read minds. With utter
  disbelief, I approached him. He covered both my ears with his palms
  and asked me to think of something. I thought of the number 5 and he
  immediately said aloud, "5". I was astonished. How could the kid
  read my mind? To ensure that he did not simply get lucky, I thought
  of another number, 7, and he immediately declared, "7". I thought of
  a few more numbers and he correctly announced all the numbers. I was
  completely bewildered. The people around were equally perplexed.
  They felt that both of us were working together to hoodwink others.
  An old man in the group who seemed intrigued by all this approached
  us and asked us to perform more experiments in a structured manner.
  He proposed that the numbers be generated using a pseudorandom
  number generator of a scientific calculator and written down on a
  paper. He asked me to silently read the numbers on each paper, then
  think of those numbers, and see whether the kid could then read my
  mind.

  While he was preparing a list of random numbers, I was trying to
  understand how on earth the kid could be reading my mind. He could
  not be have got lucky every single time. He seemed to have direct
  access to my mind. However that would be a miracle, maybe not in
  future, but it is a miracle at least today in the year 2009. I kept
  thinking, coming up with various hypotheses, and discarding them. By
  sheer luck, I thought of a contraption involving one random number
  generator (RNG) connected to two displays. In this apparatus, the
  output of the RNG appeared immediately on the first display, but
  only after a delay of 1 second on the second display. Now it would
  seem that the first display was predicting the output of the second
  display. I continued thinking more in that direction. What could
  possibly be the source of the thoughts that was accessible to both?

  After a little thought, it occurred to me that it could be my own
  mind. Probably the kid and the people I could see were simply
  creations of my mind. Perhaps, I was asleep and dreaming. I wanted
  to test the hypothesis. If it was only a dream and my mind was
  creating all the experience, I should have been able to read the
  minds of others. I had no clue how the experience of reading others'
  minds would feel like but I went ahead to test the hypothesis. I
  asked another person to be a volunteer. He agreed. I covered his
  ears with my palms and asked him to think of a number and suddenly
  the number "17" echoed in my mind. I was thrilled. I asked him
  whether "17" was the number. He confirmed that it was indeed the
  number he had thought of.

  Unfortunately, I could not stay in this state of
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dream">lucid dream</a>
  for long. I woke up soon after realizing that I was in a lucid
  dream. If you find lucid dreaming intriguing I recommend
  <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0243017/">Waking Life</a> to
  you, a very thought provoking movie that shows the experience of a
  man trapped in a persistent lucid dream state.
