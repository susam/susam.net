<h2 id="xon-xoff">XON/XOFF</h2>
<p>
  In the olden days of computing, software flow control with control
  codes XON and XOFF was a necessary feature that dumb terminals
  needed to support. When a terminal received more data than it could
  display, there needed to be a way for the terminal to tell the
  remote host to pause sending more data. The control code 19 was
  chosen for this. The control code 17 was chosen to tell the remote
  host to resume transmission of data.
</p>
<p>
  The control code 19 is called Device Control 3 (DC3) in the ASCII
  chart. It is also known as "transmit off" (XOFF). The control code
  17 is called Device Control 1 (DC1) as well as "transmit on" (XON).
  Now how does a user of the terminal really send these control codes?
  Well, how do they send any control code? Using the <kbd>ctrl</kbd>
  key of course.
</p>
<p>
  Let us take a step back and see how a user can send familiar control
  codes on modern terminal emulators, like say, the terminal software
  we find on a Unix or Linux desktop environment. While any sane
  computer user would just type the <kbd>tab</kbd> key to insert a tab
  character, one could also type <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd> to
  insert a tab character. The character <code>I</code> has code 73
  (binary 1001001) and holding the <kbd>ctrl</kbd> key while typing it
  results in a control code made by taking 73 (binary 1001001),
  keeping its five least significant bits, and discarding the rest to
  get the control code 9 (binary 1001) which is the code of the tab
  character. In other words, we get the control code by performing a
  bitwise AND operation on the code of the character being modified
  with binary code of 31 (binary 0011111).
</p>
<p>
  In case you are wondering, if we get the same result if we choose
  the binary code of the lowercase <code>i</code> to perform the
  aforementioned operation, the answer is, yes. While the code of
  uppercase <code>I</code> is 73 (binary 1001001), that of
  lowercase <code>i</code> is 105 (binary 1101001). The right-most
  five bits are same for both. Thus when we preserve the five least
  significant bits and discard the rest, we get the control code 9
  (binary 1001) in both cases. This is a neat result due to the fact
  that the five least significant bits of the code of a lowercase
  character is exactly the same as that of the corresponding uppercase
  character. They differ only in their sixth least significant bit.
  That bit is on for the lowercase character but off for the
  corresponding uppercase character. This is just an interesting
  observation as far as this post is concerned. We are not going to
  use the code of lowercase characters in the rest of this post.
</p>
<p>
  The bitwise operation mentioned earlier explains why
  typing <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>h</kbd> sends a backspace,
  typing <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>j</kbd> sends a newline, and
  typing <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>g</kbd> plays a bell. In modern terminal
  emulators these days, the bell often manifests in the form of an
  audible beep. Here is a table that summarizes these control codes
  and a few more:

  The last row in the table above explains why we can also
  type <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>[</kbd> in Vim to escape from insert mode
  to normal mode. This is infact one of the convenient ways for
  touch-typists to return to normal mode in Vim instead of clumsily
  stretching the left hand fingers out to reach the <code>esc</code>
  key which is usually poorly located at the corner of most keyboards.
</p>
<p>
  There is a bit of oversimplication in the description above.
  Throughout the history of computing, different systems have used
  slightly different methods to compute the resulting control code
  when the <kbd>ctrl</kbd> modifier key is held. Turning off both the
  6th and 7th least significant bits is one method. Subtracting 64
  from the character code is yet another method. These are
  implementation details and these various implementation methods lead
  to the same results for the examples in the table above. Then there
  are some special rules too. For example, many terminals implement a
  special rule to make <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>space</kbd> behave the
  same as <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>@</kbd> thus producing the null
  character. Further <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>?</kbd> produces the delete
  character. These special rules are summarized in the table below.

  For the purpose of this blog post, we don't need to worry about
  these special rules. Let us get back to the control codes 19 and 17
  that represent XOFF and XON. Here is how the table looks for them:
</p>
<table class="grid">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th rowspan="2">Key</th>
      <th colspan="3">Modified Character</th>
      <th colspan="3">Resulting Character</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Binary</th>
      <th>Decimal</th>
      <th>Character</th>
      <th>Binary</th>
      <th>Decimal</th>
      <th>Character</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody style="font-family: monospace, monospace">
    <tr>
      <td><kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>q</kbd></td>
      <td>1010001</td>
      <td>81</td>
      <td>Q</td>
      <td>10001</td>
      <td>17</td>
      <td>DC1 (XON)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd></td>
      <td>1010011</td>
      <td>83</td>
      <td>S</td>
      <td>10011</td>
      <td>19</td>
      <td>DC3 (XOFF)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>
  We see that a user can type <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd> to send the
  control code XOFF and then <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>q</kbd> to send the
  control code XON. Although we do not use dumb terminals anymore,
  these conventions have survived in various forms in our modern
  terminal emulators. To see a glimpse of it, launch the terminal that
  comes with a modern operating system, then run <code>ping
  localhost</code> and while this command is printing its output,
  type <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd>. The terminal should pause
  printing the output of the command. Then
  type <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>q</kbd> and the terminal should resume
  printing the output.
</p>

<h2 id="incremental-search-in-bash-zsh">Incremental Search in Bash/Zsh</h2>
<p>
  Let us now take a look at the shells that run within the terminals.
  Both Bash and Zsh are very popular these days. Both these shells
  have excellent support for performing incremental searches through
  the input history. To see a quick demonstration of this, open a new
  terminal that runs eitehr Bash or Zsh and run these commands:
</p>
<pre>
<code>echo foo
echo bar
cal
uname
echo baz</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Now type <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>r</kbd> followed by <code>echo</code>.
  This should invoke the reverse search feature of the shell and
  automatically complete the partial command <code>echo</code>
  to <code>echo baz</code>. Type <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>r</kbd> again to
  move back in the input history and autocomplete the command
  to <code>echo bar</code>. We can type <code>enter</code> anytime we
  use the reverse search feature to execute the automatically
  completed command. Typing <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>r</kbd> yet another
  time should bring the <code>echo foo</code> command at the shell
  prompt.
</p>
<p>
  What if we went too far back in the input history and now want to go
  forward? There is a good news and there is some bad news. The good
  news is that both Bash and Zsh support forward search using
  the <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd> key sequence. The bad news is that
  this key sequence may not reach the shell. Most terminal emulators
  consume this key sequence and interpret it as the control code XOFF.
</p>

<h2 id="conflict">The Conflict</h2>
<p>
  In the previous two sections, we have seen that
  the <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd> key sequence is used to send the
  control code XOFF. But the same key sequence is also used for
  forward incremental search in Bash and Zsh. Since the terminal
  consumes this key sequence and interprets it as the control code
  XOFF, the shell never sees the key sequence. As a result, the
  forward incremental search functionality does not work when we type
  this key sequence in the shell.
</p>
<p>
  Bash offers the incremental search facility via a wonderful piece of
  library known as the the GNU Readline Library. ZSH offers this
  facility with its own Zsh Line Editor (ZLE). So other tools that
  rely on these libraries to offer line editing and history capability
  are also affected by this conflict. For example, many builds of
  Python offer line editing and history capability using GNU Readline,
  so while <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>r</kbd> works fine to perform reverse
  search in the Python interpreter, it is very likely
  that <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd> does not work to perform forward
  search.
</p>


<h2 id="Reclaim-forward-incremental search">Reclaim Forward Incremental Search</h2>
<p>
  We can forfeit the usage of control codes XON/XOFF to reclaim
  forward incremental search. Here is the command to disable XON/XOFF
  output control in the terminal:
</p>
<pre><code>stty -ixon</code></pre>
<p>
  After running the command, <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd> is no longer
  consumed by the terminal to pause the output. To confirm that
  forward incremental search works now, first run the above command,
  and then run the following commands:
</p>
<pre>
<code>echo foo
echo bar
cal
uname
echo baz</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Now type <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>r</kbd> followed by <code>echo</code>
  and the input line should be automatically completed to <code>echo
  baz</code>. Type <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>r</kbd> again and <code>echo
  bar</code> should appear at the shell prompt.
  Type <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>r</kbd> one more time to bring the
  command <code>echo foo</code> at the shell prompt.
</p>
<p>
  Now type <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd> once and the search facility
  should switch itself to forward incremental search. The search
  prompt should change to show this. For example, in Bash the search
  prompt changes from <code>reverse-i-search:</code>
  to <code>i-search:</code> to indicate this. In Zsh, the search
  prompt changes from <code>bck-i-search:</code>
  to <code>fwd-i-search:</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Now type <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd> again and the input line
  should be automatically completed to <code>echo bar</code>.
  Type <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd> again to bring back <code>echo
  baz</code> at the shell prompt. This is the forward incremental
  search in action.
</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  I believe the forward incremental search facility offered in shells
  and other tools with line editing and history capabilities is a very
  useful feature that can make navigating the input history very
  convenient. However due to the default setting of most terminals,
  this rather splendid feature remains unusable.
</p>
<p>
  I believe heavy terminal users should add the command <code>stty
  -ixon</code> to their <code>~/.bash_profile</code>
  or <code>~/.zshrc</code>, so that the <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd>
  key sequence can be used for forward incremental search. Forfeit
  XON/XOFF to reclaim forward incremental search!
