<h2 id="the-prank">The Prank</h2>

<p>
My favourite email prank ends with my friends receiving an email like
this:
</p>

<div class="email">
<div class="header">
<b>From:</b> "Prunthaban Kanthakumar" &lt;p****@gmail.com&gt;<br>
<b>To:</b> "Prunthaban Kanthakumar" &lt;p****@gmail.com&gt;<br>
<b>Cc:</b> Susam Pal &lt;s****@gmail.com&gt;, John Wesley
&lt;w****@gmail.com&gt;<br>
<b>Cc:</b> Indhu Bharathi &lt;i****@gmail.com&gt;, Karthik
&lt;k****@gmail.com&gt;<br>
<b>Subject:</b> Experiment Successful
</div>
<div class="body">
<p>
I was working today (21 Dec, 2012) on an experiment to send messages to
a space-time co-ordinate in the past. If this experiment is successful I
should receive this mail on 15 Feb, 2010, a date in the past.
</p>
<p>
It is quite funny that we can remember the past but not the future.  So,
when I receive this message on (15 Feb, 2010), I wouldn't remember that
this is the result of a successful revolutionary experiment to be
performed in future. I should have got this message time stamped by a
trusted time stamping authority in order to prove that this message is
indeed from the future but that has its own problems. Why would I, in
the past, believe that such a trusted time stamping authority would
exist in the future?  Moreover, I don't have time to get all this done
as the world is coming to an end today.

<h2 id="smtp-session">SMTP Session</h2>

<p>
The prank begins with a connection to my email server with
<code>telnet</code> or <code>netcat</code> and holding an SMTP session
like this:
</p>

<h2 id="message-format">Message Format</h2>

<p>
An internet message or email consists of two sections: header and body.
The header usually consists of fields like <code>From</code>,
<code>To</code>, <code>Cc</code>, <code>Subject</code>, etc. which are
usually displayed to the user. It may have more fields like
<code>Message-ID</code>, <code>Return-Path</code>,
<code>Content-Type</code>, etc. which are usually not displayed to the
user. But many email programs provide some mechanism to view them as
well. For example, in GMail, we can click the little arrow near the
<samp>Reply</samp> button and select the <samp>Show original</samp>
option to view the message with all the message headers. In Microsoft
Office Outlook, we can go to the <samp>View</samp> menu and select
<samp>Options</samp> to see all the message headers.
</p>

<p>
These headers are used by the email client and the various programs
running on various email servers to deliver the email to the recipient's
inbox. For example, if the delivery of the email fails for some reason,
a message describing the failure is sent to the email address found in
the <code>Return-Path</code> header. This is usually the email address
of the sender. For example, the email address specified in the
<code>MAIL FROM</code> command appears in the <code>Return-Path</code>
header in the email received by the recipient.
</p>

<p>
The actual message meant to be read by the recipient is contained in the
message body. The message body begins after the message headers. The
message header and the message body are separated by an empty line.
</p>

<p>
When we compose an email using web-based email applications like GMail,
Hotmail, etc. or desktop email clients such as Microsoft Outlook,
Mozilla Thunderbird, etc., the email application or client automatically
enters the sender's email address in the <code>From</code> header field
while sending the email. Similarly, it automatically uses the email
addresses mentioned in the <code>To</code> and <code>Cc</code> fields as
recipients of the email. The email client connects to the SMTP server
and executes the necessary commands to send the email to all the
recipients mentioned in the <code>To</code> and <code>Cc</code> fields.
</p>

<p>
In the above SMTP session example, since we are manually interacting the
email server, we enter all the necessary commands ourselves. For
example, each recipient is specified with the <code>RCPT TO</code>
command. The actual email message that is displayed to the recipient by
their various email clients begins after the <code>DATA</code> command.
The message headers such as <code>From</code>, <code>Date</code>, etc.
are also composed manually.
</p>

<p>
Since we enter every SMTP command manually instead of an email
application entering it for us, we have more freedom while entering the
header values and make this prank possible. For example, we specify
a future date as the value of the <code>Date</code> header field. We
also specify a false email address as the value of the <code>From</code>
header field. There need not be any relation between the recipients
specified with the <code>RCPT TO</code> command and the email addresses
specified in <code>To</code> and <code>Cc</code> fields. It is possible
to send an email to one person with the <code>To</code> or
<code>Cc</code> header field containing the email address of another
person. Similarly, the <code>From</code> header field need not contain
the email address of the actual sender. SMTP is not concerned with the
correctness of these fields.
