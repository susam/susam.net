<p>
Once in a while, I fire up one of the vintage DOS games or language
interpreters in DOSBox for nostalgia's sake. I have archived these
vintage programs at <a
href="https://github.com/susam/dosage">github.com/susam/dosage</a>.
DOSBox is an emulator program that emulates IBM PC compatible computers
running DOS. Trying my hands on these antiquated DOS programs now evokes
old memories from my childhood days days when I first came across
computers as part of our primary school curriculum.
</p>

<p>
Computers were much simpler in those days. The ones in our school were
IBM PC compatible computers with mostly monochrome displays. A couple of
them had support for a very limited number of colours provided by CGA or
EGA graphics cards. The ability to boot a computer using a
5&frac14;-inch floppy disk containing MS-DOS, load a Logo or BASIC
interpreter, or a computer game from another floppy disk, and then write
some programs or play a few games without any distraction had its own
charm that I find missing from modern day computing.
</p>

<p>
Often while using old DOS programs with DOSBox in this day and age, I
want to take screenshot captures or video captures of the DOSBox
sessions and share them with my friends. In this article, I will explain
how I create good quality screenshot captures and video captures of
DOSBox sessions in formats that I can share with others.

<h2 id="software-versions"><a
 href="#software-versions">Software Versions</a></h2>

<p>
Since this article involves several pieces of software, some of what is
written here may not hold good in future if the behaviour of any of
these software tools change in future. The list below contains the
versions of all software tools that were used to test the commands
provided in this article:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>macOS High Sierra 10.13.6</li>
  <li>DOSBox 0.74-3</li>
  <li>FFmpeg 4.3.1</li>
  <li>ImageMagick 7.0.10-28</a>
  <li>IBM Personal Computer Logo Version 1.00</li>
  <li>Digger (Original PC booter version by Windmill Software)</li>
</ol>

<p>
Note that both Logo and Digger programs in the list above are DOS
programs that were released in 1983. They cannot be run directly on
modern computers but they can be run with DOSBox since it emulates old
IBM PC compatible computers.
</p>


<h2 id="ibm-pc-logo-in-dosbox"><a
 href="#ibm-pc-logo-in-dosbox">IBM PC Logo in DOSBox</a></h2>

<p>
IBM Personal Computer Logo developed by Logo Computer Systems Inc.
(LCSI) in 1983 was the first piece of software I got introduced to while
learning computers as a kid. I came across it at the age of 8 when I was
in Class 4 and our school had a 5&frac14;-inch floppy disk with IBM PC
Logo on it. As a result, Logo was the first programming language I
learnt in my life. About 20 years later, I would realize that the first
programming language I learnt is a dialect of Lisp. How wonderful!

<p>
If the Logo interpreter program <code>LOGO.COM</code> exists in the
current directory, it can be run with DOSBox using the following
command:
</p>

<pre><code>dosbox LOGO.COM</code></pre>

<p>
One of the things I enjoyed drawing with Logo was a grid of overlapping
circles like this:
</p>

<figure id="logo-program-screenshot">

     alt="A grid made with 20 circles along with Logo source code for it"></a>
  <figcaption>

<p>
Here is the Logo source code for the above output:
</p>

<pre>
<code>REPEAT 20 [REPEAT 180 [FD 1 RT 2] RT 18]</code>
</pre>


<h2 id="digger-in-dosbox"><a
 href="#digger-in-dosbox">Digger in DOSBox</a></h2>

<p>
At around the same time I learnt Logo, I also came across Digger, a
computer game for IBM PC developed by Windmill Software in 1983.
</p>

<figure id="digger-welcome-screenshot">
  <a href="../../files/blog/dosbox-digger-0.png"><img

  <figcaption>
    Welcome screen of Digger
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
If the Digger program <code>DIGGER.COM</code> exists in the directory,
it can be run using DOSBox with the following command:
</p>

<pre>
<code>dosbox DIGGER.COM -c "config -set cpu cycles=500" -machine cga</code>
</pre>

<p>
The <code>-machine cga</code> option emulates a machine with Color
Graphics Adapter (CGA) because Digger requires a machine of this type to
run correctly. The <code>cycles=500</code> configuration option slows
down the speed at which DOSBox emulates instructions in order to emulate
the slow machines of olden days. Without this option, Digger runs too
fast to be able to be conveniently playable.
</p>

     alt="A screenshot of underground maze in the game of Digger"></a>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Digger has an excellent gameplay where the player digs through
underground tunnels to pick up emeralds, drop gold bags to release the
gold or squash nobbins and hobbins, collect the released gold to earn
more points, and so on. It uses bright and attractive colours. The music
is great. When Digger was released in 1983, it was quite advanced for
its time.
</p>



<h2 id="dosbox-screenshot-capture"><a
 href="#dosbox-screenshot-capture">DOSBox Screenshot Capture</a></h2>

<p>
The screenshots above were obtained by running IBM PC Logo and the
original 1983 PC booter version of Digger on DOSBox and then resizing
the screenshots such that their aspect ratio matches the aspect ratio of
old CRT computer monitors.
</p>

<p>
To obtain the screenshots, we first press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> +
<kbd>F5</kbd> while DOSBox is running. The paths of the screenshots
appear in the console output at the terminal where DOSBox was launched.
For example:
</p>

<pre>
<samp>Capturing Screenshot to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/logo_000.png
Capturing Screenshot to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/logo_001.png</samp>
</pre>

<pre>
<samp>Capturing Screenshot to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/digger_000.png
Capturing Screenshot to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/digger_001.png</samp>
</pre>

<p>
The screenshots obtained in this manner have an aspect ratio of 8:5
which makes the output look stretched horizontally. The old CRT computer
monitors for which these old DOS programs were written had an aspect
ratio of 4:3 instead. This stretched look can be fixed by resizing the
images to an aspect ratio of 4:3. Here are the commands used to fix the
aspect ratio and produce the images:
</p>

<pre>
<code>convert logo_000.png -sample '1920x1440!' dosbox-logo-0.png
convert logo_001.png -sample '1920x1440!' dosbox-logo-1.png</code>
</pre>
<pre>
<code>convert digger_000.png -sample '1920x1440!' dosbox-digger-0.png
convert digger_001.png -sample '1920x1440!' dosbox-digger-1.png</code>
</pre>

<p>
The <code>convert</code> program comes with ImageMagick. There are a few
things worth noting here:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    We use the <code>-sample</code> option here to resize the image as
    opposed to using <code>-resize</code> or <code>-scale</code>. The
    <code>-resize</code> or <code>-scale</code> option would smooth the
    jagged edges in the text and graphics by introducing additional
    colours. The <code>-resize</code> option is great for real world
    images where we do want the edges to be smooth while scaling up or
    down but in these screenshots we want to retain the crisp and jagged
    edges that is typical of DOSBox and the old CRT monitors. Therefore
    we use the <code>-sample</code> option that does not introduce any
    new colours. Instead it uses nearest-neighbour interpolation (point
    sampling) to decide the colours of the scaled image.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code>!</code> flag is used to ignore the aspect ratio of the
    original image. Without this flag, the output files would be
    1920x1200 in size, that is, the largest size with an aspect ratio of
    8:5 that fits in a 1920x1440 box. With this flag, the original
    aspect ratio of 8:5 is ignored and the output is exactly 1920x1440
    in size.

<h2 id="dosbox-video-capture"><a
 href="#dosbox-video-capture">DOSBox Video Capture</a></h2>

<p>
To start capturing video of DOSBox, we press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> +
<kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd>. The same key combination stops capturing
video. The following output appears in the console output to show where
the video file is saved:
</p>

<pre>
<samp>Capturing Video to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/logo_000.avi
Stopped capturing video.</samp>
</pre>

<p>
Say, I want to share a video capture of DOSBox with Logo running on it
with my friends who might be on devices that do not support playing AVI
files. The following FFmpeg command converts the video to a format that
can be distributed widely and played on a wide range of devices and
players:
</p>

<pre>
<code>ffmpeg -i logo_000.avi -an -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow \
       -crf 17 -vf format=yuv420p,scale=1920:1440:flags=neighbor,fps=30 \
       dosbox-logo.mp4</code>
</pre>

<p>
Here is what the output looks like:
</p>

<figure id="logo-video">
  <video controls>
    <source src="../../files/blog/dosbox-logo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
  <figcaption>
    Video capture of IBM Personal Computer Logo
    [<a href="../../files/blog/dosbox-logo.mp4">MP4</a>]
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Let us briefly discuss the various FFmpeg options used here:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>-i logo_000.avi</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      This, of course, specifies the input file.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>-an</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      The audio is silent in this video, so we reduce the file size a
      little by disabling the audio stream with this option. For
      example, without this option the output file size was 317 KB but
      with this option it turned out to be 282 KB.
    </p>
    <p>
      This option should not be specified if the audio stream needs to
      preserved, for example, with DOS games that have audio. We will
      see an example of this in the next section.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>-c:v libx264</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      This option selects the x264 encoder to encode the video stream
      into H.264 format. H.264 is also known as MPEG-4 Part 10, Advanced
      Video Coding (MPEG-4 AVC). Currently, it is the most popular
      format for recording, compression, and distribution of video
      content.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>-crf 17</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      This option provides visually lossless output, that is, high
      quality output without any loss in quality that can be perceived
      by human eyes. For completely lossless output, we need to use the
      <code>-crf 0</code> option. However, this option sets the video
      profile to <code>High 4:4:4 Predictive</code> which prevents the
      video from playing in some video players. This issue is discussed
      in more detail in the point about <code>yuv420p</code> pixel
      format that comes later in this list. Since <code>-crf 0</code>
      cannot be used due to this issue, the next best option is
      <code>-crf 1</code> which while not completely lossless is much
      better than visually lossless. Since it trades quality for output
      size, the output file turns out to be 319 KB in size. The
      <code>-crf 51</code> option produces the most lossy output, that
      is, the worst quality output with a file size of 159 KB.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>-preset veryslow</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      This option provides better compression at the cost of encoding
      speed. For example, without this option it produces an output of
      size 355 KB in about 16 seconds on my system but with this option
      it produces an output of size 282 KB in about 31 seconds on the
      same system.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>-vf format=yuv420p</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      This video filter option ensures that the output video file can be
      run in a wide range of devices and players.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, without this video filter option, we get the output
      in the YUV 4:4:4 planar format. I found that QuickTime Player
      version 10.4 on macOS High Sierra as well as Android 9.0.0 was
      unable to play this format.
    </p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>ffmpeg -v quiet -i logo_000.avi -an -c:v libx264 dosbox-logo.mp4</kbd>
$ <kbd>ffprobe -v error -show_entries stream=codec_name,profile,pix_fmt dosbox-logo.mp4</kbd>
[STREAM]
codec_name=h264
profile=High 4:4:4 Predictive
pix_fmt=yuv444p
[/STREAM]</samp>
</pre>
    <p>
      With this video filter option, we get the output in the YUV 4:2:0
      planar format. Now both QuickTime Player version 10.4 as well as
      Android 9.0.0 could play this format.
    </p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>ffmpeg -v quiet -i logo_000.avi -an -c:v libx264 -vf format=yuv420p dosbox-logo.mp4</kbd>
$ <kbd>ffprobe -v error -show_entries stream=codec_name,profile,pix_fmt dosbox-logo.mp4</kbd>
[STREAM]
codec_name=h264
profile=High
pix_fmt=yuv420p
[/STREAM]</samp>
</pre>
    <p>
      For maximum compatibility with very old or obsolete devices, we
      could add the <code>-profile:v baseline</code> option that
      setst the video profile to <code>Constrained Baseline</code>. This
      option is not recommended unless we really need to support old or
      obsolete devices. We also need to keep in mind that the baseline
      profile does not support lossless encoding with the <code>-crf
      0</code> option. The least lossy encoding option we can specify
      with this profile is <code>-crf 1</code> which while not
      technically lossless is much better than visually lossless.
    </p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>ffmpeg -v quiet -i logo_000.avi -an -c:v libx264 -vf format=yuv420p -profile:v baseline dosbox-logo.mp4</kbd>
$ <kbd>ffprobe -v error -show_entries stream=codec_name,profile,pix_fmt dosbox-logo.mp4</kbd>
[STREAM]
codec_name=h264
profile=Constrained Baseline
pix_fmt=yuv420p
[/STREAM]</samp>
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>scale=1920:1440:flags=neighbor</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      With this video filter option, we resize the video to maintain an
      aspect ratio of 4:3, that is, the aspect ratio of the old CRT
      computer monitors, so that the output looks similar to how it used
      to look on those monitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>neighbor</code> flag ensures that the nearest-neighbor
      interpolation (point sampling) is used to decide the colours of
      the scaled image. Without this option, the default bicubic
      interpolation algorithm is used. It has the effect of smoothing
      the edges by introducing new colours such as new shades of grey
      for this example video. While such smoothing of edges is good for
      scaling pictures of the real world, in this case, it spoils the
      crisp and jagged edges that is typical of output visible in DOSBox
      or the old CRT monitors. With the <code>neighbor</code> option, we
      retain the crisp and jagged edges visible in the original video
      capture.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>fps=30</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      This video filter option sets the frame rate to 30 frames per
      second (FPS). Without this option, the output
      video has a frame rate of 70.09 FPS and file size of 558 KB. With
      this option the output frame rate is 30 FPS and the file size is
      282 KB.
    </p>
    <p>
      The default value of <code>machine</code> configuration variable
      of DOSBox v0.74-3 is <code>svga_s3</code>, so by default it
      emulates a machine with SVGA card. While emulating a machine with
      SVGA card, DOSBox creates video capture files with frame rate of
      70.09 FPS. When it emulates a machine with CGA card, such as when
      the its <code>machine</code> configuration variable is set to
      <code>cga</code> or when DOSBox is run with the <code>-machine
      cga</code> option, it creates video captures files with frame rate
      of 59.92 FPS.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the <a href="#logo-video">Logo video capture</a>, there is no
      high-speed motion going on in the video, so we don't need a high
      frame rate. A lower frame rate of 30 FPS looks just as good.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>


<h2 id="dosbox-audio-video-capture"><a
 href="#dosbox-audio-video-capture">DOSBox Audio/Video Capture</a></h2>

<p>
The video capture of Digger game is processed similarly, however, there
are a few additional things we need to take care of. We want to include
the game audio in the output file. We also want a higher frame rate
because games may sometimes have high-speed motion.
</p>

<p>
Like before, we use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd> to
start capturing the video. The same key combination stops capturing
video. The following output appears in the console output to show where
the video file is saved:
</p>

<pre>
<samp>Capturing Video to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/digger_000.avi
Stopped capturing video.</samp>
</pre>

<p>
Here is the command to convert the video capture of Digger to a
distributable format:
</p>

<pre>
<code>ffmpeg -i digger_000.avi -c:a aac -b:a 256k -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow \
       -crf 17 -vf format=yuv420p,scale=1920:1440:flags=neighbor,fps=50 \
       dosbox-digger.mp4</code>
</pre>

<p>
Here is the output:
</p>

<figure id="digger-video">

    [<a href="../../files/blog/dosbox-digger.mp4">MP4</a>]
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Most of the FFmpeg options used in the command above have been discussed
in the previous section. Let us discuss the new options used here that
have not been discussed earlier:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>-c:a aac</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      This option selects the native FFmpeg AAC encoder to encode the
      audio stream to Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) format. It is a very
      popular format for audio streams in MP4 files.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>-b:a 256k</code>
    </p>

      This sets the audio bitrate high enough to ensure that we get good
      quality audio in the output. We don't need to worry about the
      our specified bitrate being too high. If the audio can be encoded
      with a lower bitrate without compromising on quality, the output
      audio stream is encoded at a lower bitrate. For example, for this
      specific video, the actual audio bitrate in the output file turns
      out to be 245k because that is enough to encode the audio stream
      in the input file.

      If we set the frame rate to a lower value like 30 FPS like we did
      in the previous section, we still get pretty good output, however,
      certain parts of the output video look slightly choppy. For
      example, at 7 seconds into the video when the player is the
      pushing up against the gold bag, the video becomes slightly choppy
      if we generate the output with a frame rate of 30 FPS. A higher
      frame rate such as 50 FPS prevents this problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we omit this option entirely, we get an output video that has
      the same frame rate as that of the input video, that is, 59.92
      FPS, with an output file size of 4.6 MB. With this option, we get
      an output video that has a frame rate of 50 FPS and a file size of
      4.2 MB.

If we look at the output video above closely enough, we see that the
colours don't look as crisp as they do in the <a
href="#digger-game-screenshot">Digger game screenshot</a>. The
<code>neighbor</code> flag was very effective at maintaining the crisp
and jagged edges in the <a href="#logo-video">Logo video capture</a> but
it does not produce perfect results for the <a
href="#digger-video">Digger video capture</a> in this section. Despite
the imperfection, it is still necessary to specify the
<code>neighbor</code> option because without this option, the output
video looks even worse. We can use a different pixel format like
<code>yuv444p</code> instead of <code>yuv420p</code> to work around this
issue. Using the <code>yuv444p</code> format indeed results in perfect
nearest-neighbour interpolation which helps in retaining the crisp and
jagged edges in the video accurately but as explained in the previous
section, many media players currently cannot play this pixel format, so
we stick to using the <code>yuv420p</code> format in this article.

Now just for fun, let us see if we can convert the video captures into
GIF animations. This can be done quite easily with FFmpeg. Here are the
commands to convert the Logo video capture to GIF animation:
</p>

<pre>
<samp>ffmpeg -i logo_000.avi -vf palettegen palette.png
ffmpeg -i logo_000.avi -i palette.png \
       -lavfi 'scale=1920:1440:flags=neighbor,paletteuse,fps=30' \
       dosbox-logo.gif</samp>
</pre>

<p>
The first command generates a colour palette from the video capture. The
second command uses this colour palette to generate a GIF animation.
Like before, we use the <code>neighbor</code> flag to retain the crisp
and jagged edges. Here is the output:

animation:
