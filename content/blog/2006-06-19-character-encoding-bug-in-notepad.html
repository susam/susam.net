<!-- title: Character Encoding Bug in Notepad -->

<p>
I came across an interesting bug in Notepad last week. I have verified
that this bug is reproducible in Windows XP. Older versions might be
affected as well. Here are the steps to reproduce the issue:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open Notepad.</li>
  <li>
    Enter the following text exactly as shown here:
    <pre><samp>this app can break</samp></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Save the file.</li>
  <li>Close Notepad.</li>
  <li>Open the file again with Notepad.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Some users may find Chinese characters instead of the English text that
was entered. Others may find 9 boxes instead.
</p>

<p>
A similar issue happens with other strings like the following ones:
</p>

<pre><samp>Bush hid the facts</samp></pre>
<pre><samp>Bill hid the facts</samp></pre>
<pre><samp>aa aaa aaa</samp></pre>
<pre><samp>bb bbb bbb</samp></pre>

<p>
We can craft many more such strings that trigger this bug if we
understand what causes this bug.
</p>


<h2 id="cause-of-the-bug"><a href="#cause-of-the-bug">Cause of the Bug</a></h2>
<p>
Let us take the following text as an example and try to understand
what is going on:
</p>

<pre><samp>this app can break</samp></pre>

<p>
Here are the hexadecimal codes for the characters in the string:
</p>

<pre>
<samp>74 68 69 73 20 61 70 70 20 63 61 6e 20 62 72 65 61 6b</samp>
</pre>

<p>
Now let us try to interpret these 18 bytes as if they represent UTF-16LE
encoded characters. After rearranging them to represent UTF-16LE encoded
characters, we get 9 UTF-16LE encoded characters with the following code
points:
</p>

<pre>
<samp><a href="https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/6874/">6874</a> <!--
--><a href="https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/7369/">7369</a> <!--
--><a href="https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/6120/">6120</a> <!--
--><a href="https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/7070/">7070</a> <!--
--><a href="https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/6320/">6320</a> <!--
--><a href="https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/6e61/">6e61</a> <!--
--><a href="https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/6220/">6220</a> <!--
--><a href="https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/6572/">6572</a> <!--
--><a href="https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/6b61/">6b61</a></samp>
</pre>

<p>
Click the codes above to see what the characters they represent look
like. Each code represents a CJK ideograph. CJK stands for Chinese,
Japanese, and Korean.
</p>

<p>
We can see now that the 18 bytes entered into Notepad also happen to
represent 9 valid CJK ideographs when encoded using UTF-16LE. When
Notepad opens a text file, it finds that the bytes in the file happen to
be valid UTF-16LE characters, so it attempts to display them as the
corresponding UTF-16LE characters. Those who do not have CJK fonts
installed on their systems see them appear as boxes.

One of my friends, after playing a little with this bug, asked me,
"When I create that file for the first time, I see 9 boxes. But if I
open the same file, delete everything, type the same thing again, close
it, and open it again, I don't see 9 boxes any more. I can read the
English text without issues now. Does it mean that for some reason this
time Notepad can interpret them as ASCII encoded characters?"
</p>

<p>
The answer is: No! In fact it is just the opposite. This time Notepad
correctly saves them as UTF-16LE encoded characters.
</p>

<p>
The first time Notepad saves the data in ASCII encoding. The next time
it saves it as UTF-16LE encoded characters.
</p>

<p>
Let us create the file for the first time and see what each byte looks
like using the <samp>debug</samp> program of DOS.
</p>

<pre>
<samp>C:\&gt;<kbd>debug foo.txt</kbd>
-<kbd>r ip</kbd>
IP 0100
:
-<kbd>d 100 11f</kbd>
0B66:0100  74 68 69 73 20 61 70 70-20 63 61 6E 20 62 72 65  this app can bre
0B66:0110  61 6B BC 00 72 16 03 D3-13 C8 E8 B3 34 00 55 0B  ak..r.......4.U.
-</samp>
</pre>

<p>
When we open this file using Notepad and edit, Notepad considers the
text to be in UTF-16LE encoding due to reasons explained earlier in
this post. Therefore it displays the text as CJK ideographs or boxes (if
CJK fonts are missing). Now when we erase the text and write the same
English text again, the English text is saved in UTF-16LE encoding (not
ASCII encoding like the first time). This can be confirmed with the
<samp>debug</samp> command.
</p>

<pre>
<samp>C:\&gt;<kbd>debug a.txt</kbd>
-<kbd>r ip</kbd>
IP 0100
:
-<kbd>d 100 11f</kbd>
0B66:0100  FF FE 74 00 68 00 69 00-73 00 20 00 61 00 70 00   ..t.h.i.s.  .a.p.
0B66:0110  70 00 20 00 63 00 61 00-6E 00 20 00 62 00 72 00   p. .c.a.n.  .b.r.
-</samp>
</pre>

<p>
The two bytes <samp>FF</samp> and <samp>EE</samp> in the beginning is
the byte order mark (BOM) for UTF-16LE encoding. The remaining bytes are
the characters of the text in UTF-16LE encoding.
</p>
