  <em>Universally Unique Identifiers</em> or UUIDs are a popular way
  of creating identifiers that are unique for <em>practical</em>
  purposes.  Quoting from
  <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4122">RFC 4122</a>
  below:
</p>
<blockquote>
  This specification defines a Uniform Resource Name namespace for
  UUIDs (Universally Unique IDentifier), also known as GUIDs (Globally
  Unique IDentifier).  A UUID is 128 bits long, and requires no
  central registration process.
</blockquote>
<p>
  These 128-bit identifiers are typically represented as 32
  hexadecimal digits, displayed in five groups separated by hyphens.
  There are various variants and versions of UUIDs which differ in how
  the identifiers are encoded in binary and how they are generated.
  In this post, we are going to focus only on variant 1 of version 4
  UUIDs, also known simply as version 4 UUIDs or random UUIDs.  Here
  are a couple examples of version 4 UUIDs generated using Python:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>import uuid</kbd>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>str(uuid.uuid4())</kbd>
'980ddc6a-2c56-44da-ac71-9e6bfc924e25'
&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>str(uuid.uuid4())</kbd>
'10c3fcde-96a0-4c9e-905b-443b00ceeb01'</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  Version 4 UUID is one of the most popular type of UUIDs in use
  today.  Unlike the other versions, this version does not require
  external inputs like MAC address, sequence number, current time,
  etc.  All except six bits are generated randomly in version 4 UUIDs.
  The six non-random bits are fixed.  They represent the version and
  variant of the UUID.  Here is a tiny Python program that
  demonstrates the first set of fixed bits:
</p>
<pre><code>while str(uuid.uuid4())[14] == '4': pass</code></pre>
<p>
  The above program is an infinite loop.  So is this:
</p>
<pre><code>while str(uuid.uuid4())[19] in ['8', '9', 'a', 'b']: pass</code></pre>
<p>
  The above infinite loops show that the hexademical digit at index 14
  must always be 4.  Similarly, the hexadecimal digit at index 19 must
  always be one of 8, 9, a, and b.  We can see the two examples of
  version 4 UUIDs mentioned earlier and confirm that this is indeed
  the case.  Here are a few more examples that illustrate this
  pattern:
</p>
<pre>
<code>527218be-a09e-<span class="hl">4</span>d0e-<span class="hl">8</span>6ce-c39d1348d953
14163389-2eea-<span class="hl">4</span>e30-<span class="hl">9</span>124-fcf2451eb9fc
c21b57cc-2a4e-<span class="hl">4</span>425-<span class="hl">a</span>2f4-129256562599
37700270-6deb-<span class="hl">4</span>a73-<span class="hl">b</span>bcd-d47c6e20b567</code>
</pre>
<p>
  The digit after the second hyphen is at index 14 and indeed this
  digit is always 4.  Similarly, the hexadecimal digit after the third
  hyphen is at index 19 and indeed it is always one of 8, 9, a, and b.
</p>
<p>
  If we number the octets in the identifiers as 0, 1, 2, etc. where 0
  represents the most significant octet (the leftmost pair of
  hexadecimal digits in the string representations above), then with a
  careful study of
  <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4122#section-4.1.1">section
  4.1.1</a> of RFC 4122 we know that the first two most significant
  bits of octet 8 represent the variant number.  Since we are working
  with variant 1 of version 4 UUIDs, these two bits must be 1 and 0.
  As a result, octet 8 must be of the form 10xx xxxx in binary where
  each x represents an independent random bit.  Thus, in binary, the
  four most significant bits of octet 8 must be one of 1000, 1001,
  1010, and 1011.  This explains why we always see the hexadecimal
  digit 8, 9, a, or b at this position.
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, a study of
  <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4122#section-4.1.2">section 4.1.2</a>
  and <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4122#section-4.1.3">section 4.1.3</a>
  of the RFC shows that the four most significant bits of octet 6 must
  be set to 0100 to represent the version number 4.  This explains why
  we always see the hexadecimal digit 4 here.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4122#section-4.4">Section
  4.4</a> of RFC 4122 further summarises these points.  To summarise,
  version 4 UUIDs, although 128 bits in length, have 122 bits of
  randomness.  They have six fixed bits that represent its version and
  variant.
