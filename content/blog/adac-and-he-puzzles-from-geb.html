  I have been reading
  <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach"
  class="title">G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden
  Braid</a></em> by Douglas R. Hofstadter for a few weeks.  The book
  follows an interesting format of alternating between chapters and
  dialogues between imaginary charaters.  In the words of the author:
</p>
<blockquote>
  The long and the short of it is that I eventually decided - but this
  took many months - that the optimal structure would be a strict
  alternation between chapters and dialogues.  Once that was clear,
  then I had the joyous task of trying to pinpoint the most crucial
  ideas that I wanted to get across to my readers and then somehow
  embodying them in both the form and the content of fanciful, often
  punning dialogues between Achilles and the Tortoise (plus a few new
  friends).
</blockquote>
<p>
  After the second chapter (Chapter II: Meaning and Form in
  Mathematics) there is a dialogue between Achilles and the Tortoise
  on telephone.  The title of the dialogue is <em>Sonata for
  Unaccompanied Achilles</em>.  The text shows the transcript of only
  one end of the call, only what Achilles speaks.  The Tortoise is at
  the far end of the call.  The sentences spoken by the Tortoise at
  the other end are not present in the text.  This makes the reading
  experience very interesting as we keep guessing about what is going
  on at the other end.
</p>
<p>
  It starts in this manner:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <em>Achilles:</em> Hello, this is Achilles.<br>
  <em>Achilles:</em> Oh, hello, Mr. T. How are you?<br>
  <em>Achilles:</em> A torticollis?  Oh, I'm sorry to hear it.  Do you
  have any idea what caused it?
</blockquote>
<p>
  As the dialogue proceeds, they share a few puzzles.  Here is the
  first one from the Tortoise.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <em>Achilles:</em> A word with the letters 'A', 'D', 'A', 'C'
  consecutively inside it &hellip; Hmm &hellip; What about
  "abracadabra"?<br>
  <em>Achilles:</em> True, "ADAC" occurs backwards, not forwards, in
  that word.<br>
  <em>Achilles:</em> Hours and hours?  It sounds like I'm in for a
  long puzzle, then.  Where did you hear this infernal riddle?
</blockquote>
<p>
  Here is the second puzzle from Achilles:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <em>Achilles:</em> Say, I once heard a word puzzle a little bit like
  this one.  Do you want to hear it?  Or would it just drive you
  further into distraction?<br>
  <em>Achilles:</em> I agree - can't do any harm.  Here it is: What's
  a word that begins with the letters "HE" and also ends with
  "HE"?<br>
  <em>Achilles:</em> Very ingenious - but that's almost cheating.
  It's certainly not what I meant!<br>
  <em>Achilles:</em> Of course you're right - it fulfills the
  conditions, but it's a sort of "degenerate" solution.  There's
  another solution which I had in mind.<br>
  <em>Achilles:</em> That's exactly it!  How did you come up with it
  so fast?<br>
  <em>Achilles:</em> So here's a case where having a headache actually
  might have helped you, rather than hindering you.  Excellent!  But
  I'm still in the dark on your "ADAC" puzzle.
</blockquote>
<p>
  <em>If you want to think about these puzzles, this is a good time to
  pause and think about them.  There are spoilers ahead.</em>
</p>
<p>
  It did not take much time for me to solve the puzzle because I
  cheated with the word list file available on Linux distributions.
  Here is what I found with my Debian 5.0 (lenny) system:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>grep 'adac' /usr/share/dict/words</kbd>
headache
headache's
headaches
$ <kbd>grep '^he.*he$' /usr/share/dict/words</kbd>
headache
heartache</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  The answers to both puzzles seem to be "HEADACHE".  Take another
  look at the last sentence in the dialogue above.  It makes sense now
  as Achilles says that having a <em>headache</em> might have helped
  the Tortoise.
</p>
<p>
  Later in the dialogue the Tortoise offers <em>figure</em> and
  <em>ground</em> as hints to the "ADAC" puzzle.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <em>Achilles:</em> Well, normally I don't like hints, but all right.
  What's your hint?<br>
  <em>Achilles:</em> I don't know what you mean by "figure" and
  "ground" in this case.<br>
  <em>Achilles:</em> Certainly I know Mosaic II!  I know ALL of
  Escher's works.  After all, he's my favorite artist.  In any case,
  I've got a print of Mosaic II hanging on my wall, in plain view from
  here.<br>
  <em>Achilles:</em> Yes, I see all the black animals.<br>
  <em>Achilles:</em> Yes, I also see how their "negative" space -
  what's left out - defines the white animals.<br>
  <em>Achilles:</em> So THAT's what you mean by "figure" and "ground".
  But what does that have to do with the "ADAC" puzzle?<br>
  <em>Achilles:</em> Oh, this is too tricky to me.  I think I'M
  starting to get a headache.
</blockquote>
<p>
  The famous painting discussed in the dialogue can be found
  here: <a href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/m-c-escher/mosaic-ii">https://www.wikiart.org/en/m-c-escher/mosaic-ii</a>.
  We can see how the black animals form the <em>figure</em> (the
  positive space) and how the background or <em>ground</em> (the
  negative space) beautifully fits all the white animals.
</p>
<p>
  The <em>figure</em> and <em>ground</em> in hints make sense now.
  The first puzzle has "ADAC" in the question.  Let us consider "ADAC"
  as the figure or the positive space.  If we remove "ADAC" from
  "HEADACHE", we are left with the ground or negative space, which
  consists of "HE" and "HE" at the beginning and the end of the word.
  The <em>figure</em> is used in the first puzzle and
  the <em>ground</em> is used in the second puzzle.
</p>
<p>
  By the way, what is the first answer from the Tortoise that Achilles
  finds very ingenious but degenerate?  I believe, it is "HE" as this
  word both begins and ends with "HE".
</p>
<p>
  The funny thing about this dialogue is that both of them asked two
  puzzles to each other without knowing that the answers to them were
  the same.  A similar thing happened to me when a colleague of mine
  and I challenged each other with combinatorics puzzles.  See this
  blog post for the story:
