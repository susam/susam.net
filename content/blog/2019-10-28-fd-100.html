  I learnt how to write computer programs in IBM/LCSI PC Logo. That
  was back in the year 1992. Computers were much simpler in those
  days. The ones in our school were IBM PC compatible computers with
  mostly monochrome displays. The ability to boot a computer using a
  5Â¼-inch floppy disk containing MS-DOS, load a Logo interpreter and
  then write some programs without any distraction had its own charm
  that I find missing from modern day computing.

  The first line of code I ever wrote was:

  Here is how the output looks:

  That is the "hello, world" of turtle graphics in Logo. That simple
  line of code changed my world. I could make stuff happen in an
  otherwise mostly blank monochrome CRT display. Until then I had seen
  CRTs in televisions where I had very little control on what I see on
  the screen. But now, I had control! The turtle became my toy and I
  could make it draw anything on a 320 &times; 250 canvas.
</p>

<h2 id="polygons">Polygons</h2>
<p>
  With a little knowledge of geometry, one could draw polygons. Often
  the first polygon one would learn to draw is a square. It involves
  making the turtle walk forward 100 steps, then turn right 90&deg;,
  and repeat these two operations four times in a loop. Here is the
  code:
</p>
<pre><code>REPEAT 4 [FD 100 RT 90]</code></pre>
<p>
  Here is the output:
</p>
<figure>
  <a href="../files/blog/logo-square.png"><img

      alt="A square drawn with Logo along with source code"></a>
  <figcaption>

</figure>

<p>
  Similarly, one could draw other polygons. The only thing my
  nine-year-old self then needed to understand was that after drawing
  an entire polygon, the turtle is back to its original position
  having completed one full turn. Therefore to draw a polygon with \(
  n \) sides, the turtle needs to turn by \( 360 / n \) degrees after
  drawing each side. Drawing a pentagon is as simple as:
</p>
<pre><code>REPEAT 5 [FD 80 RT 72]</code></pre>
<p>
  Here is the output:
</p>
<figure>

      alt="A pentagon drawn with Logo along with source code"></a>
  <figcaption>

</figure>
<p>
  The same approach works for drawing a regular five-pointed star too.
  The only new thing we need to consider here is that as the turtle
  draws the shape, it makes two full turns. Therefore, it must turn by
  \( 720 / 5 \) degrees after drawing each side. Here is the code:
</p>
<pre><code>REPEAT 5 [FD 100 RT 144]</code></pre>
<p>
  Here is the output:
</p>

  I remember feeling uneasy about the lopsided appearance of the
  polygons above and then trying to please my sense of aesthetics by
  centring these polygons horizontally on the screen and having them
  stand firmly on an imaginary horizontal line so that they look
  balanced. I won't include the code and output for that on this page
  for the sake of brevity of this post but here are links to some
  screenshots I have kept that show a few of several ways to do it:
  <a href="../files/blog/logo-square-centered.png">logo-square-centered.png</a>,
  <a href="../files/blog/logo-pentagon-centered.png">logo-pentagon-centered.png</a>, and
  <a href="../files/blog/logo-star-centered.png">logo-star-centered.png</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="circles">Circles</h2>
<p>
  Going from polygons to circles was especially fun. Here is the first
  piece of code one would normally write to learn to draw a circle:
</p>
<pre><code>REPEAT 360 [FD 1 RT 1]</code></pre>
<p>
  Here is the output:
</p>
<figure>
  <a href="../files/blog/logo-circle.png"><img
      src="../files/blog/logo-circle.png"
      alt="A circle drawn with Logo along with source code"></a>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  Now precisely speaking, this is not exactly a circle. This is a
  triacosiahexeacontagon, i.e., a 360-gon. It is an approximation of a
  circle with 360 very short line segments. Nevertheless it was enough
  to get a young child who has just begun to learn using the computer
  excited about programming. It showed me how control flow can be used
  elegantly to express complex ideas in a simple expression. By the
  way, here is one way to center that circle horizontally on the
  screen: <a href="../files/blog/logo-circle-centered.png">logo-circle-centered.png</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Soon after learning to draw a circle, I learnt to write this:
</p>
<pre><code>REPEAT 20 [REPEAT 180 [FD 1 RT 2] RT 18]</code></pre>
<p>
  This code draws 20 overlapping circles. The output looks like this:

<h2 id="a-lasting-effect">A Lasting Effect</h2>
<p>
  There is a lot more to Logo than turtle graphics.
</p>
<p>
  Logo gave me a brief taste of functional programming even though
  back then I did not know the term "functional programming". I
  discovered the same simplicity and elegance later in Lisp about 15
  years later. After all, Logo can be thought of as a dialect of Lisp
  without parentheses that controls a turtle.
</p>
<p>
  At an impressionable age of nine, reading and writing code like
  this, and using simple arithmetic, geometry, logic, and code to
  manipulate a two-dimensional world had a lasting effect on me. Back
  in those days, I used to find joy in sharing some of my interesting
  Logo programs with my teachers and friends. I like to believe that
  my passion for software engineering as well as my love for writing
  code, sharing code, and open source development are a result of
  coming across these beautiful code examples early in my life.
