<p>
  Fizz Buzz is a counting game that has become oddly popular in the
  world of computer programming as a simple test of basic programming
  skills.  The rules of the game are straightforward.  Players say the
  numbers aloud in order beginning with one.  Whenever a number is
  divisible by 3, they say 'Fizz' instead.  If it is divisible by 5,
  they say 'Buzz'.  If it is divisible by both 3 and 5, the player
  says both 'Fizz' and 'Buzz'.  Here is a typical Python program that
  prints this sequence:
</p>
<pre><code>for n in range(1, 101):
    if n % 15 == 0:
        print('FizzBuzz')
    elif n % 3 == 0:
        print('Fizz')
    elif n % 5 == 0:
        print('Buzz')
    else:
        print(n)</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Here is the output:
  <a href="files/blog/fizz-buzz.txt">fizz-buzz.txt</a>.  Can we make
  the program more complicated?  The words 'Fizz', 'Buzz' and
  'FizzBuzz' repeat in a periodic manner throughout the sequence.
  What else is periodic?  Trigonometric functions!  Perhaps we can use
  trigonometric functions to encode all four rules of the sequence in
  a single closed-form expression.  That is what we are going to
  explore in this article, for fun and no profit.
</p>
<p>
  By the end, we will obtain a discrete Fourier series that can take
  any integer \( n \) and select the corresponding text to be printed.
  In fact, we will derive it using two different methods.  First, we
  will follow a long-winded but hopefully enjoyable approach that
  relies on a basic understanding of complex exponentiation, geometric
  series and trigonometric functions.  Then, we will obtain the same
  result through a direct application of the discrete Fourier
  transform.

<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>
<p>
  Before going any further, we establish a precise mathematical
  definition for the Fizz Buzz sequence.  We begin by introducing a
  few functions that will help us define the Fizz Buzz sequence later.
</p>
<h3 id="symbol-functions">Symbol Functions</h3>
<p>
  We define a set of four functions \( \{ s_0, s_1, s_2, s_3 \} \) for
  integers \( n \) by:

  \begin{align*}
    s_0(n) &amp;= n, \\
    s_1(n) &amp;= \mathtt{Fizz}, \\
    s_2(n) &amp;= \mathtt{Buzz}, \\
    s_3(n) &amp;= \mathtt{FizzBuzz}.
  \end{align*}

  We call these the symbol functions because they produce every term
  that appears in the Fizz Buzz sequence.  The symbol function \( s_0
  \) returns \( n \) itself.  The functions \( s_1 \), \( s_2 \) and
  \( s_3 \) are constant functions that always return the literal
  words \( \mathtt{Fizz} \), \( \mathtt{Buzz} \) and \(
  \mathtt{FizzBuzz} \) respectively, no matter what the value of \( n
  \) is.
</p>
<h3 id="index-function">Index Function</h3>
<p>
  We define a function \( f(n) \) for integer \( n \) by

  \[
    f(n) = \begin{cases}
      1 &amp; \text{if } 3 \mid n \text{ and } 5 \nmid n, \\
      2 &amp; \text{if } 3 \nmid n \text{ and } 5 \mid n, \\
      3 &amp; \text{if } 3 \mid n \text{ and } 5 \mid n, \\
      0 &amp; \text{otherwise}.
    \end{cases}
  \]

  The notation \( m \mid n \) means that the integer \( m \) divides
  the integer \( n \), i.e. \( n \) is a multiple of \( m \).
  Equivalently, there exists an integer \( c \) such that \( n = cm
  \).  Similarly, \( m \nmid n \) means that \( m \) does not divide
  \( n \), i.e. \( n \) is not a multiple of \( m \).
</p>
<p>
  This function covers all four conditions involved in choosing the \(
  n \)th item of the Fizz Buzz sequence.  As we will soon see, this
  function tells us which of the four symbol functions produces the \(
  n \)th item of the Fizz Buzz sequence.  For this reason, we call \(
  f(n) \) the index function.
</p>
<h3 id="fizz-buzz-sequence">Fizz Buzz Sequence</h3>
<p>
  We now define the Fizz Buzz sequence as the sequence

  \[
    (s_{f(n)}(n))_{n = 1}^{\infty}
  \]

  We can expand the first few terms of the sequence explicitly as
  follows:

  \begin{align*}
    (s_{f(n)}(n))_{n = 1}^{\infty}
    &amp;= (s_{f(1)}(1), \; s_{f(2)}(2), \; s_{f(3)}(3), \; s_{f(4)}(4), \;
            s_{f(5)}(5), \; s_{f(6)}(6), \; s_{f(7)}(7), \; \dots) \\
    &amp;= (s_0(1), \; s_0(2), \; s_1(3), \; s_0(4),
            s_2(5), \; s_1(6), \; s_0(7), \; \dots) \\
    &amp;= (1, \; 2, \; \mathtt{Fizz}, \; 4, \;
            \mathtt{Buzz}, \; \mathtt{Fizz}, \; 7, \; \dots).
  \end{align*}

  Note how the function \( f(n) \) produces an index \( i \) which we
  then use to select the symbol function \( s_i(n) \) to produce the
  \( n \)th term of the sequence.  This is precisely why we decided to
  call \( f(n) \) the index function while defining it in the previous
  section.
</p>
<h2 id="from-indicator-functions-to-cosines">From Indicator Functions to Cosines</h2>
<p>
  Here we discuss the first method of deriving our closed form
  expression, starting with indicator functions and rewriting them
  using complex exponentials and cosines.
</p>
<h3 id="indicator-functions">Indicator Functions</h3>
<p>
  Here is the index function \( f(n) \) from the previous section with
  its cases and conditions rearranged to make it easier to spot
  interesting patterns:

  \[
    f(n) = \begin{cases}
      0 &amp; \text{if } 5 \nmid n \text{ and } 3 \nmid n, \\
      1 &amp; \text{if } 5 \nmid n \text{ and } 3 \mid n, \\
      2 &amp; \text{if } 5 \mid n \text{ and } 3 \nmid n, \\
      3 &amp; \text{if } 5 \mid n \text{ and } 3 \mid n.
    \end{cases}
  \]

  This function helps us select another function \( s_{f(n)}(n) \)
  which in turn determines the \( n \)th term of the Fizz Buzz
  sequence.  Our goal now is to replace this piecewise formula with a
  single closed-form expression.  To do so, we first define indicator
  functions \( I_m(n) \) as follows:

  \[
    I_m(n) = \begin{cases}
      1 &amp; \text{if } m \mid n, \\
      0 &amp; \text{if } m \nmid n.
    \end{cases}
  \]

  The formula for \( f(n) \) can now be written as:

  \[
    f(n) = \begin{cases}
      0 &amp; \text{if } I_5(n) = 0 \text{ and } I_3(n) = 0, \\
      1 &amp; \text{if } I_5(n) = 0 \text{ and } I_3(n) = 1, \\
      2 &amp; \text{if } I_5(n) = 1 \text{ and } I_3(n) = 0, \\
      3 &amp; \text{if } I_5(n) = 1 \text{ and } I_3(n) = 1.
    \end{cases}
  \]

  Do you see a pattern?  Here is the same function written as a table:
</p>
<table class="grid center textcenter">
  <tr>
    <th>\( I_5(n) \)</th>
    <th>\( I_3(n) \)</th>
    <th>\( f(n) \)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\( 0 \)</td>
    <td>\( 0 \)</td>
    <td>\( 0 \)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\( 0 \)</td>
    <td>\( 1 \)</td>
    <td>\( 1 \)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\( 1 \)</td>
    <td>\( 0 \)</td>
    <td>\( 2 \)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\( 1 \)</td>
    <td>\( 1 \)</td>
    <td>\( 3 \)</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  Do you see it now?  If we treat the values in the first two columns
  as binary digits and the values in the third column as decimal
  numbers, then in each row the first two columns give the binary
  representation of the number in the third column.  For example, \(
  3_{10} = 11_2 \) and indeed in the last row of the table, we see the
  bits \( 1 \) and \( 1 \) in the first two columns and the number \(
  3 \) in the last column.  In other words, writing the binary digits
  \( I_5(n) \) and \( I_3(n) \) side by side gives us the binary
  representation of \( f(n) \).  Therefore

  \[
    f(n) = 2 \, I_5(n) + I_3(n).
  \]

  We can now write a small program to demonstrate this formula:
</p>
<pre>
<code>for n in range(1, 101):
    s = [n, 'Fizz', 'Buzz', 'FizzBuzz']
    i = (n % 3 == 0) + 2 * (n % 5 == 0)
    print(s[i])</code>
</pre>
<p>
  We can make it even shorter at the cost of some clarity:
</p>
<pre>
<code>for n in range(1, 101):
    print([n, 'Fizz', 'Buzz', 'FizzBuzz'][(n % 3 == 0) + 2 * (n % 5 == 0)])</code>
</pre>
<p>
  What we have obtained so far is pretty good.  While there is no
  universal definition of a closed-form expression, I think most
  people would agree that the indicator functions as defined above are
  simple enough to be permitted in a closed-form expression.
</p>
<h3 id="complex-exponentials">Complex Exponentials</h3>
<p>
  In the previous section, we obtained the formula

  \[
    f(n) = I_3(n) + 2 \, I_5(n)
  \]

  which we then used as an index to look up the text to be printed.
  We also argued that this is a pretty good closed-form expression
  already.
</p>
<p>
  However, in the interest of making things more complicated, we must
  ask ourselves: What if we are not allowed to use the indicator
  functions?  What if we must adhere to the commonly accepted meaning
  of a closed-form expression which allows only finite combinations of
  basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication,
  division, integer exponents and roots with integer index as well as
  functions such as exponentials, logarithms and trigonometric
  functions.  It turns out that the above formula can be rewritten
  using only addition, multiplication, division and the cosine
  function.  Let us begin the translation.  Consider the sum

  \[
    S_m(n) = \sum_{k = 0}^{m - 1} e^{i 2 \pi k n / m},
  \]

  where \( i \) is the imaginary unit and \( n \) and \( m \) are
  integers.  This is a geometric series in the complex plane with
  ratio \( r = e^{i 2 \pi n / m} \).  If \( n \) is a multiple of \( m
  \), then \( n = cm \) for some integer \( c \) and we get

  \[
    r
    = e^{i 2 \pi n / m}
    = e^{i 2 \pi c}
    = 1.
  \]

  Therefore, when \( n \) is a multiple of \( m \), we get

  \[
    S_m(n)
    = \sum_{k = 0}^{m - 1} e^{i 2 \pi k n / m}
    = \sum_{k = 0}^{m - 1} 1^k
    = m.
  \]

  If \( n \) is not a multiple of \( m \), then \( r \ne 1 \) and the
  geometric series becomes

  \[
    S_m(n)
    = \frac{r^m - 1}{r - 1}
    = \frac{e^{i 2 \pi n} - 1}{e^{i 2 \pi n / m} - 1}
    = 0.
  \]

  Therefore,

  \[
    S_m(n) = \begin{cases}
      m &amp; \text{if } m \mid n, \\
      0 &amp; \text{if } m \nmid n.
    \end{cases}
  \]

  Dividing both sides by \( m \), we get

  \[
    \frac{S_m(n)}{m} = \begin{cases}
      1 &amp; \text{if } m \mid n, \\
      0 &amp; \text{if } m \nmid n.
    \end{cases}
  \]

  But the right-hand side is \( I_m(n) \).  Therefore

  \[
    I_m(n)
    = \frac{S_m(n)}{m}
    = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{k = 0}^{m - 1} e^{i 2 \pi k n / m}.
  \]
</p>
<h3 id="cosines">Cosines</h3>
<p>
  We begin with Euler's formula

  \[
    e^{i x} = \cos x + i \sin x
  \]

  where \( x \) is a real number.  From this formula, we get

  \[
    e^{i x} + e^{-i x} = 2 \cos x.
  \]

  Therefore

  \begin{align*}
    I_3(n)
    &amp;= \frac{1}{3} \sum_{k = 0}^2 e^{i 2 \pi k n / 3} \\
    &amp;= \frac{1}{3} \left( 1 + e^{i 2 \pi n / 3} +
                                  e^{i 4 \pi n / 3} \right) \\
    &amp;= \frac{1}{3} \left( 1 + e^{i 2 \pi n / 3} +
                                  e^{-i 2 \pi n / 3} \right) \\
    &amp;= \frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{3} \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi n}{3} \right).
  \end{align*}

  The third equality above follows from the fact that \( e^{i 4 \pi n
  / 3} = e^{i 6 \pi n / 3} e^{-i 2 \pi n / 3} = e^{i 2 \pi n} e^{-i 2
  \pi n/3} = e^{-i 2 \pi n / 3} \) when \( n \) is an integer.
</p>
<p>
  The function above is defined for integer values of \( n \) but we
  can extend its formula to real \( x \) and plot it to observe its
  shape between integers.  As expected, the function takes the value
  \( 1 \) whenever \( x \) is an integer multiple of \( 3 \) and \( 0
  \) whenever \( x \) is an integer not divisible by \( 3 \).
</p>

  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  Similarly,

  \begin{align*}
    I_5(n)
    &amp;= \frac{1}{5} \sum_{k = 0}^4 e^{i 2 \pi k n / 5} \\
    &amp;= \frac{1}{5} \left( 1 + e^{i 2 \pi n / 5}
                                + e^{i 4 \pi n / 5}
                                + e^{i 6 \pi n / 5}
                                + e^{i 8 \pi n / 5} \right) \\
    &amp;= \frac{1}{5} \left( 1 + e^{i 2 \pi n / 5}
                                + e^{i 4 \pi n / 5}
                                + e^{-i 4 \pi n / 5}
                                + e^{-i 2 \pi n / 5} \right) \\
    &amp;= \frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5} \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi n}{5} \right)
                       + \frac{2}{5} \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi n}{5} \right).
  \end{align*}

  Extending this expression to real values of \( x \) allows us to
  plot its shape as well.  Once again, the function takes the value \(
  1 \) at integer multiples of \( 5 \) and \( 0 \) at integers not
  divisible by \( 5 \).

    \)
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  Recall that we expressed \( f(n) \) as

  \[
    f(n) = I_3(n) + 2 \, I_5(n).
  \]

  Substituting these trigonometric expressions yields

  \[
    f(n)
    = \frac{1}{3}
      + \frac{2}{3} \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi n}{3} \right)
      + 2 \cdot \left(
        \frac{1}{5}
        + \frac{2}{5} \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi n}{5} \right)
        + \frac{2}{5} \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi n}{5} \right)
      \right).
  \]

  A straightforward simplification gives

  \[
    f(n)
    = \frac{11}{15}
      + \frac{2}{3} \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi n}{3} \right)
      + \frac{4}{5} \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi n}{5} \right)
      + \frac{4}{5} \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi n}{5} \right).
  \]

  We can extend this expression to real \( x \) and plot it as well.
  The resulting curve takes the values \( 0, 1, 2 \) and \( 3 \) at
  integer points, as desired.

  Now we can write our Python program as follows:
</p>
<pre>
<code>from math import cos, pi
for n in range(1, 101):
    s = [n, 'Fizz', 'Buzz', 'FizzBuzz']
    i = round(11 / 15 + (2 / 3) * cos(2 * pi * n / 3)
                      + (4 / 5) * cos(2 * pi * n / 5)
                      + (4 / 5) * cos(4 * pi * n / 5))
    print(s[i])</code>
</pre>
<h2 id="dft">Discrete Fourier Transform</h2>
<p>
  The keen-eyed might notice that the expression we obtained for \(
  f(n) \) is a discrete Fourier series.  This is not surprising, since
  the output of a Fizz Buzz program depends only on \( n \bmod 15 \).
  Any function on a finite cyclic group can be written exactly as a
  finite Fourier expansion.  In this section, we obtain \( f(n) \)
  using the discrete Fourier transform.  It is worth mentioning that
  the calculations presented here are quite tedious to do by hand.
  Nevertheless, this section offers a glimpse of how such calculations
  are performed.  By the end, we will arrive at exactly the same \(
  f(n) \) as before.  There is nothing new to discover here.  We
  simply obtain the same result by a more direct but more laborious
  method.  If this doesn't sound interesting, you may safely skip the
  subsections that follow.
</p>
<h3 id="one-period-of-fizz-buzz">One Period of Fizz Buzz</h3>
<div style="display: none">\( \gdef\arraystretch{1.2} \)</div>
<p>
  We know that \( f(n) \) is a periodic function with period \( 15 \).
  To apply the discrete Fourier transform, we look at one complete
  period of the function using the values \( n = 0, 1, \dots, 14 \).
  Over this period, we have:

  \begin{array}{c|ccccccccccccccc}
      n &amp;  0 &amp;  1 &amp;  2 &amp;  3 &amp;  4
        &amp;  5 &amp;  6 &amp;  7 &amp;  8 &amp;  9
        &amp; 10 &amp; 11 &amp; 12 &amp; 13 &amp; 14 \\
    \hline
    f(n) &amp; 3 &amp;  0 &amp;  0 &amp;  1 &amp;  0
         &amp; 2 &amp;  1 &amp;  0 &amp;  0 &amp;  1
         &amp; 2 &amp;  0 &amp;  1 &amp;  0 &amp;  0
  \end{array}

  The discrete Fourier series of \( f(n) \) is

  \[
    f(n) = \sum_{k = 0}^{14} c_k \, e^{i 2 \pi k n / 15}
  \]

  where the Fourier coefficients \( c_k \) are given by the discrete
  Fourier transform

  \[
    c_k = \frac{1}{15} \sum_{n = 0}^{14} f(n) e^{-i 2 \pi k n / 15}.
  \]

  for \( k = 0, 1, \dots, 14 \).  The formula for \( c_k \) is called
  the discrete Fourier transform (DFT).  The formula for \( f(n) \) is
  called the inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT).
</p>
<h3 id="fourier-coefficients">Fourier Coefficients</h3>
<p>
  Let \( \omega = e^{-i 2 \pi / 15} \).  Then using the values of \(
  f(n) \) from the table above, the DFT becomes:

  \[
    c_k = \frac{3 + \omega^{3k} + 2 \omega^{5k} + \omega^{6k}
                  + \omega^{9k} + 2 \omega^{10k} + \omega^{12k}}{15}.
  \]

  Substituting \( k = 0, 1, 2, \dots, 14 \) into the above equation
  gives us the following Fourier coefficients:

  \begin{align*}
    c_{0}  &amp;= \frac{11}{15}, \\
    c_{3}  &amp;= c_{6} = c_{9} = c_{12} = \frac{2}{5}, \\
    c_{5}  &amp;= c_{10} = \frac{1}{3}, \\
    c_{1}  &amp;= c_{2} = c_{4} = c_{7} = c_{8} = c_{11} = c_{13} = c_{14} = 0.
  \end{align*}

  Calculating these Fourier coefficients by hand can be rather
  tedious.  In practice they are almost always calculated using
  numerical software, computer algebra systems or even simple code
  such as the example here:
  <a href="code/fizz-buzz-fourier/fizz-buzz-fourier.py">fizz-buzz-fourier.py</a>.
</p>
<h3 id="inverse-transform">Inverse Transform</h3>
<p>
  Once the coefficients are known, we can substitute them into the
  inverse transform introduced earlier to obtain

  \begin{align*}
    f(n)
    &amp;= \sum_{k = 0}^{14} c_k \, e^{i 2 \pi k n / 15} \\[1.5em]
    &amp;= \frac{11}{15}

             + e^{i 2 \pi \cdot 9n / 15}
             + e^{i 2 \pi \cdot 12n / 15}
           \right) \\

  This is exactly the same expression for \( f(n) \) we obtained in
  the previous section.  We see that the Fizz Buzz index function \(
  f(n) \) can be expressed precisely using the machinery of Fourier
  analysis.
</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  To summarise, we have defined the Fizz Buzz sequence as

  \[
    (s_{f(n)}(n))_{n = 1}^{\infty}
  \]

  where

  \[
    f(n)
    = \frac{11}{15} +
      \frac{2}{3} \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi n}{3} \right) +
      \frac{4}{5} \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi n}{5} \right) +
      \frac{4}{5} \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi n}{5} \right).
  \]

  and \( s_0(n) = n \), \( s_1(n) = \mathtt{Fizz} \), \( s_2(n) =
  \mathtt{Buzz} \) and \( s_3(n) = \mathtt{FizzBuzz} \).  A Python
  program to print the Fizz Buzz sequence based on this definition was
  presented earlier.  That program can be written more succinctly as
  follows:
</p>
<pre>
<code>from math import cos, pi
for n in range(1, 101):
    print([n, 'Fizz', 'Buzz', 'FizzBuzz'][round(11 / 15 + (2 / 3) * cos(2 * pi * n / 3) + (4 / 5) * (cos(2 * pi * n / 5) + cos(4 * pi * n / 5)))])</code>
</pre>
<p>
  We can also wrap this up nicely in a shell one-liner, in case you
  want to share it with your friends and family and surprise them:
</p>
<pre><code>python3 -c 'from math import cos, pi; [print([n, "Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz"][round(11/15 + (2/3) * cos(2*pi*n/3) + (4/5) * (cos(2*pi*n/5) + cos(4*pi*n/5)))]) for n in range(1, 101)]'</code></pre>
<p>
  We have taken a simple counting game and turned it into a
  trigonometric construction consisting of a discrete Fourier series
  with three cosine terms and four coefficients.  None of this makes
  Fizz Buzz any easier.  Quite the contrary.  But it does show that
  every \( \mathtt{Fizz} \) and \( \mathtt{Buzz} \) now owes its
  existence to a particular set of Fourier coefficients.  We began
  with the modest goal of making this simple problem more complicated.
  I think it is safe to say that we did not fall short.
