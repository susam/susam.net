  I have a measuring technique that is neither fast, nor accurate, nor
  recommended by any standards body and yet it hasn't failed me
  whenever I have had to use it.  I'll share it here but don't ever
  use it for installing kitchen cabinets or anything that will stare
  back at you every day for the next ten years.  It involves one tool:
  a sheet of A4 paper.
</p>
<p>
  Like most sensible people with a reasonable sense of priorities, I
  do not carry a ruler with me wherever I go.  But I have nevertheless
  found myself, with surprising regularity, required to measure
  something at short notice, usually in situations where a certain
  amount of inaccuracy is entirely forgivable.  When I cannot fetch a
  ruler easily, I rely on the next best thing: a sheet of A4 paper,
  which is available in abundant supply where I live.
</p>
<p>
  From photocopying night-sky charts to serving as a scratch pad for
  working through mathematical proofs, A4 paper has been a trusted
  companion since my childhood days.  I use it often.  If I am
  carrying a bag, there is almost always some A4 paper inside: perhaps
  a printed research paper or a mathematical problem I have worked on
  recently and need to chew on a bit more during my next train ride.
</p>
<h2 id="dimensions">Dimensions</h2>
<p>
  The dimensions of A4 paper are the solution to a simple, elegant
  problem.  Imagine designing a sheet of paper such that, when you cut
  it in half parallel to its shorter side, both halves have exactly
  the same aspect ratio as the original.  In other words, if the
  shorter side has length \( x \) and the longer side has length \( y
  \), then

  \[
    \frac{y}{x} = \frac{x}{y / 2}
  \]

  which gives us

  \[
    \frac{y}{x} = \sqrt{2}.
  \]

  Test it out.  Suppose we have \( y/x = \sqrt{2} \).  We cut the
  paper in half parallel to the shorter side to get two halves, each
  with shorter side \( x' = y / 2 \) and longer side \( y' = x \).
  Then indeed

  \[
    \frac{y'}{x'}
    = \frac{x}{y / 2}
    = \frac{x}{x \sqrt{2} / 2}
    = \sqrt{2}.
  \]

  In fact, we can keep cutting the halves like this and we'll keep
  getting even smaller sheets with the aspect ratio \( \sqrt{2} \)
  intact.  To summarise, when a sheet of paper has the aspect ratio \(
  \sqrt{2} \), bisecting it parallel to the shorter side leaves us
  with two halves that preserve the aspect ratio.  A4 paper has this
  property.
</p>
<p>
  But what are the exact dimensions of A4 and why is it called A4?
  What does 4 mean here?  Like most good answers, this one too begins
  by considering the numbers \( 0 \) and \( 1 \).  Let me elaborate.
</p>
<p>
  Let us say we want to make a sheet of paper that is \( 1 \,
  \mathrm{m}^2 \) in area and has the aspect-ratio-preserving property
  that we just discussed.  What should its dimensions be?  We want

  \[
    xy = 1 \, \mathrm{m}^2
  \]

  subject to the condition

  \[
    \frac{y}{x} = \sqrt{2}.
  \]

  Solving these two equations gives us

  \[
    x^2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \, \mathrm{m}^2
  \]

  from which we obtain

  \[
    x = \frac{1}{\sqrt[4]{2}} \, \mathrm{m}, \quad
    y = \sqrt[4]{2} \, \mathrm{m}.
  \]

  Up to three decimal places, this amounts to

  \[
    x = 0.841 \, \mathrm{m}, \quad
    y = 1.189 \, \mathrm{m}.
  \]

  These are the dimensions of A0 paper.  It is quite large to scribble
  mathematical solutions on, unless your goal is to make a spectacle
  of yourself and cause your friends and family to reassess your
  sanity.  So we need something smaller that allows us to work in
  peace, without inviting commentary or concerns from passersby.  We
  take the A0 paper of size

  \[
    84.1 \, \mathrm{cm} \times 118.9 \, \mathrm{cm}
  \]

  and bisect it to get A1 paper of size

  \[
    59.4 \, \mathrm{cm} \times 84.1 \, \mathrm{cm}.
  \]

  Then we bisect it again to get A2 paper with dimensions

  \[
    42.0 \, \mathrm{cm} \times 59.4 \, \mathrm{cm}.
  \]

  And once again to get A3 paper with dimensions

  \[
    59.4 \, \mathrm{cm} \times 42.0 \, \mathrm{cm}.
  \]

  And then once again to get A4 paper with dimensions

  \[
    21.0 \, \mathrm{cm} \times 29.7 \, \mathrm{cm}.
  \]

  There we have it.  The dimensions of A4.  These numbers are etched
  in my memory like the multiplication table of \( 1 \).  We can keep
  going further to get A5, A6, etc.  We could, in theory, go all the
  way up to A\( \infty \).  Hold on, I think I hear someone heckle.
  What's that?  Oh, we can't go all the way to A\( \infty \)?
  Something about atoms, was it?  Hmm.  Security!  Where's security?
  Ah yes, thank you, sir.  Please show this gentleman out, would you?
</p>
<p>
  Sorry for the interruption, ladies and gentlemen.  Phew!  That
  fellow!  Atoms?  Honestly.  We, the mathematically inclined, are not
  particularly concerned with such trivial limitations.  We drink our
  tea from doughnuts.  We are not going to let the size of atoms
  dictate matters, now are we?
</p>
<p>
  So I was saying that we can bisect our paper like this and go all
  the way to A\( \infty \).  That reminds me.  Last night I was at a
  bar in Hoxton and I saw an infinite number of mathematicians walk
  in.  The first one asked, "Sorry to bother you, but would it be
  possible to have an A0 sheet of paper?  I just need something to
  scribble a few equations on."  The second one asked, "If you happen
  to have one spare, could I please have an A1 sheet?"  The third one
  said, "An A2 would be perfectly fine for me, thank you."  Before the
  fourth one could ask, the bartender disappeared into the back for a
  moment and emerged with two sheets of A0 paper and said, "Right.
  That should do it.  Do know your limits and split these between
  yourselves."
</p>
<p>
  In general, a sheet of A\( n \) paper has the dimensions

  \[
    2^{-(2n + 1)/4} \, \mathrm{m} \times
    2^{-(2n - 1)/4} \, \mathrm{m}.
  \]

  If we plug in \( n = 4 \), we indeed get the dimensions of A4 paper:

  \[
    0.210 \, \mathrm{m} \times 0.297 \, \mathrm{m}.
  \]
</p>
<h2 id="measuring-stuff">Measuring Stuff</h2>
<p>
  Let us now return to the business of measuring things.  As I
  mentioned earlier, the dimensions of A4 are lodged firmly into my
  memory.  Getting hold of a sheet of A4 paper is rarely a challenge
  where I live.  I have accumulated a number of A4 paper stories over
  the years. Let me share a recent one.  I was hanging out with a few
  folks of the nerd variety one afternoon when the conversation
  drifted, as it sometimes does, to a nearby computer monitor that
  happened to be turned off.  At some point, someone confidently
  declared that the screen in front of us was 27 inches.  That sounded
  plausible but we wanted to confirm it.  So I reached for my trusted
  measuring instrument: an A4 sheet of paper.  What followed was
  neither fast, nor especially precise, but it was more than adequate
  for settling the matter at hand.
</p>
<p>
  I lined up the longer edge of the A4 sheet with the width of the
  monitor.  One length.  Then I repositioned it and measured a second
  length.  The screen was still sticking out slightly at the end.  By
  eye, I put the remaining bit at about \( 1 \, \mathrm{cm} \).  That
  gives us

  \[
    29.7 \, \mathrm{cm} +
    29.7 \, \mathrm{cm} +
     1.0 \, \mathrm{cm}
    =
    60.4 \, \mathrm{cm}.
  \]

  Let us round that down to \( 60 \, \mathrm{cm} \).  For the height,
  I switched to the shorter edge.  One full \( 21 \mathrm{cm} \) fit
  comfortably.  For the remainder, I folded the paper parallel to the
  shorter side, producing an A5-sized rectangle with dimensions \(
  14.8 \, \mathrm{cm} \times 21.0 \, \mathrm{cm} \).  Using the \(
  14.8 \, \mathrm{cm} \) edge, I discovered that it overshot the top
  of the screen slightly.  Again, by eye, I estimated the excess at
  around \( 2 \, \mathrm{cm} \).  That gives us

  \[
    21.0 \, \mathrm{cm} +
    14.8 \, \mathrm{cm}
    -2.0 \, \mathrm{cm}
    =
    33.8 \, \mathrm{cm}.
  \]

  Let us round this up to \( 34 \, \mathrm{cm} \).  The ratio \( 60 /
  34 \approx 1.76 \) is quite close to \( 16/9 \), a popular aspect
  ratio of modern displays.  At this point the measurements were
  looking good.  So far, the paper had not embarrassed itself.
  Invoking the wisdom of the Pythagoreans, we can now estimate the
  diagonal as

  \[
    \sqrt{(60 \, \mathrm{cm})^2 + (34 \, \mathrm{cm})^2}
    \approx 68.9 \,\mathrm{cm}.
  \]

  Finally, there is the small matter of units.  One inch is \( 2.54 \,
  \mathrm{cm} \), another figure that has embedded itself in my head.
  Dividing \( 68.9 \) by \( 2.54 \) gives us roughly \( 27.2 \,
  \mathrm{in} \).  So yes.  It was indeed a \( 27 \)-inch display.  My
  elaborate exercise in showing off my A4 paper skills was now
  complete.  Nobody said anything.  A few people looked away in
  silence.  I assumed they were reflecting.  I am sure they were
  impressed deep down.  Or perhaps... no, no.  They were definitely
  impressed.  I am sure.
</p>
<p>
  Hold on.  I think I hear another heckle.  What is that?  There are
  mobile phone apps that can measure things now?  Really?  Right.
  Security.  Where's security?
