  About three years ago, I set up a tiny <code>netcat</code> loop on
  one of my Debian servers to accept arbitrary connections from the
  Hacker News (HN) community.  The loop ran for 24 hours and did
  exactly three things whenever a client connected:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Send a simple <code>ok</code> message to the client.
  </li>
  <li>
    Close the connection immediately.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make my terminal beep four times.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  That's it!  It was a playful experiment in response to a thread
  about quirky, do-it-yourself alerting systems for friends and
  family.  See
  <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30146019#30146451">this
  HN thread</a> for the original discussion.  Here is the exact
  command I ran on my server:
</p>
<pre class="wrap"><code>while true; do (echo ok | nc -q 1 -vlp 8000 2&gt;&amp;1; echo; date -u) | tee -a beeper.log; for i in 1 2 3 4; do printf '\a'; sleep 1; done &amp; done</code></pre>
<p>
  The <code>nc</code> command closes the connection immediately after
  sending the <code>ok</code> message and runs an
  inner <code>for</code> loop in a background shell that
  asynchronously prints the bell character to the terminal four times.
  Meanwhile, the outer <code>while</code> command loops back quickly
  to run a new <code>nc</code> process, thus making this one-liner
  script instantly ready to accept the next incoming connection.
</p>
<p>
  Soon after I shared this, members of the HN community began
  connecting to the demo running on <code>susam.net:8000</code>.
  Anyone on the Internet could use any client of their choice to
  connect.  Here's how I explained it in the HN thread:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Now anytime someone connects to port 8000 of my system
    by <em>any</em> means, I will hear 4 beeps!  The other party can
    use <em>whatever client</em> they have to connect to port 8000 of
    my system, e.g., a web browser, <code>nc HOST
    8000</code>, <code>curl HOST:8000</code>, or even, <code>ssh HOST
    -p 8000</code>, <code>irssi -c HOST -p 8000</code>, etc.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  In the next 24 hours, I received over 4761 connections, each one
  triggering four beeps.  That's a total of 19&#x202f;044 terminal
  beeps echoing throughout the day!

  Now, 4761 isn't a huge number in the grand scheme of things, but it
  was still pretty cool to see people notice an obscure comment buried
  in a regular HN thread, act on it and make my terminal beep
  thousands of time.
</p>
<p>
  At the end of the day, this was a fun experiment.  Pointless, but
  fun!  Computing isn't always about solving problems.  Sometimes,
  it's also about exploring quirky ideas.  The joy is in the
  exploration and having others join in made it even more enjoyable.
  Activities like this keep computing fun for me!

  <strong>Update on 10 Apr 2025:</strong>
  I <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43642123">shared
  this article on Hacker News</a> today and saw another surge in
  connections to my beeper loop.

  The data for the above graph is available at
  <a href="https://gist.github.com/susam/3cec5db1a78a9db527327460656daeae">beeper2.log</a>.
  The data shows a total of 352&#x202f;831 connections from 1396
  unique client addresses over 14 hours.  That amounts to a total of
  1&#x202f;411&#x202f;324 beeps!  Much of the traffic seems to have
  come from persistent client loops constantly connecting to my beeper
  loop.  In particular, the client identified by the anonymised
  identifier C0276 made the largest number of connections by far, with
  327&#x202f;209 total connections.  The second most active client,
  C0595, made only 6771 connections.  There were 491 clients that
  connected exactly once.  If you'd like to see the number of
  connections by each client, see
  <a href="https://gist.github.com/susam/d6766f4b722f899250a8f3da0c98f993">beeperclient2.log</a>.

<p>
  In conclusion, the difference in the volume of connections between
  the earlier experiment and today's is striking.  In the first round,
  three years ago, there were only 4761 connections from some readers
  of a comment thread.  But in today's round, with this post being
  featured on the HN front page, there were 352&#x202f;831
  connections!  It is fascinating to see how odd experiments like this
  can find so many participants within the HN community!
