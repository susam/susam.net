  The following 12-byte program composed of pure x86 machine code
  writes itself to standard output when executed in a DOS environment:
</p>
<pre><code>fc b1 0c ac 92 b4 02 cd 21 e2 f8 c3</code></pre>
<p>
  We can write these bytes to a file with the .COM extension and
  execute it in DOS.  It runs successfully in MS-DOS 6.22, Windows 98,
  as well as in DOSBox and writes a copy of itself to standard output.

<h2 id="demo">Demo</h2>
<p>
  On a Unix or Linux system, the following commands demonstrate this
  program with the help of DOSBox:
</p>
<pre>
<code>echo fc b1 0c ac 92 b4 02 cd 21 e2 f8 c3 | xxd -r -p &gt; foo.com
dosbox -c 'MOUNT C .' -c 'C:\FOO &gt; C:\OUT.COM' -c 'EXIT'
diff foo.com OUT.COM</code>
</pre>
<p>
  The <code>diff</code> command should produce no output confirming
  that the output of the program is identical to the program itself.
  On an actual MS-DOS 6.22 system or a Windows 98 system, we can
  demonstrate this program in the following manner:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>C:\&gt;<kbd>DEBUG</kbd>
-<kbd>E 100 fc b1 0c ac 92 b4 02 cd 21 e2 f8 c3</kbd>
-<kbd>N</kbd> FOO.COM

C:\&gt;<kbd>FC FOO.COM OUT.COM</kbd>
Comparing files FOO.COM and OUT.COM
FC: no differences encountered</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  In the <code>DEBUG</code> session shown above, we use the debugger
  command <code>E</code> to enter the machine code at offset 0x100 of
  the code segment.  Then we use the <code>N</code> command to name
  the file we want to write this machine code to.  The command <code>R
  CX</code> is used to specify that we want to write 0xC (decimal 12)
  bytes to this file.  The <code>W</code> command writes the 12 bytes
  entered at offset 0x100.  The <code>Q</code> command quits the
  debugger.  Then we run the new <code>FOO.COM</code> program while
  redirecting its output to <code>OUT.COM</code>.  Finally, we use
  the <code>FC</code> command to compare the two files and confirm
  that they are exactly the same.
</p>
<p>
  Let us disasssemble this program now and see what it does.  The
  output below is generated using the Netwide Disassembler (NDISASM),
  a tool that comes with Netwide Assembler (NASM):
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>ndisasm -o 0x100 foo.com</kbd>
00000100  FC                cld
00000101  B10C              mov cl,0xc
00000103  AC                lodsb
00000104  92                xchg ax,dx
00000105  B402              mov ah,0x2
00000107  CD21              int 0x21
00000109  E2F8              loop 0x103
0000010B  C3                ret</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  When DOS executes a program in .COM file, it loads the machine code
  in the file at offset 0x100 of the code segment chosen by DOS.  That
  is why we ask the disassembler to assume a load address of 0x100
  with the <code>-o</code> command line option.  The first instruction
  clears the direction flag.  The purpose of this instruction is
  explained later.  The next instruction sets the register CL to 0xc
  (decimal 12).  The register CH is already set to 0 by default when a
  .COM program starts.  Thus setting the register CL to 0xc
  effectively sets the entire register CX to 0xc.  The register CX is
  used as a loop counter for the <code>loop 0x103</code> instruction
  that comes later.  Everytime this loop instruction executes, it
  decrements CX and makes a near jump to offset 0x103 if CX is not 0.
  This results in 12 iterations of the loop.
</p>
<p>
  In each iteration of the loop, the instructions from offset 0x103 to
  offset 0x109 are executed.  The <code>lodsb</code> instruction loads
  a byte from address DS:SI into AL.  When DOS starts executing this
  program, DS and SI are set to CS and 0x100 by default, so at the
  beginning DS:SI points to the first byte of the program.
  The <code>xchg</code> instruction exchanges the values in AX and DX.
  Thus the byte we just loaded into AL ends up in DL.  Then we set AH
  to 2 and generate the software interrupt 0x21 (decimal 33) to write
  the byte in DL to standard output.  This is how each iteration reads
  a byte of this program and writes it to standard output.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>lodsb</code> instruction increments or decrements SI
  depending on the state of the direction flag (DF).  When DF is
  cleared, it increments SI.  If DF is set, it decrements SI.  We use
  the <code>cld</code> instruction at the beginning to clear DF, so
  that in each iteration of the loop, SI moves forward to point to the
  next byte of the program.  This is how the 12 iterations of the loop
  write 12 bytes of the program to standard output.  In many DOS
  environments, the DF flag is already in cleared state when a .COM
  program starts, so the CLD instruction could be omitted in such
  environments.  However, there are some environments where DF may not
  be in cleared state when our program starts, so it is a best
  practice to clear DF before relying on it.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, when the loop terminates, we execute the <code>RET</code>
  instruction to terminate the program.
</p>
<h2 id="quine-conundrums">Quine Conundrums</h2>
<p>
  While reading the description of the self-printing program presented
  earlier, one might wonder if it is a quine.  While there is no
  standardised definition of the term <em>quine</em>, it is generally
  accepted that a quine is a computer program that takes no input and
  produces an exact copy of its own source code as its output.  Since
  a quine cannot take any input, tricks involving reading its own
  source code or evaluating itself are ruled out.
</p>
<p>
  For example, this shell script is a valid quine:
</p>
<pre><code>s='s=\47%s\47;printf "$s" "$s"\n';printf "$s" "$s"</code></pre>
<p>
  However, the following shell script is not considered a proper
  quine:
</p>
<pre><code>cat $0</code></pre>
<p>
  The shell script above reads its own source code which is considered
  cheating.  Improper quines like this are often called <em>cheating
  quines</em>.
</p>
<p>
  Is our 12-byte x86 program a quine?  It turns out that we have a
  conundrum.  There is no notion of source code for our program.
  There would have been one if we had written out the source code of
  this program in assembly language.  In such a case we would first
  need to choose an assembler and a proper quine would need to produce
  an exact copy of the assembly language source code (not the machine
  code bytes) for the chosen assembler.  But we are not doing that
  here.  We want the machine code to produce an exact copy of itself.
  There is no source code involved.  We only have machine code.  So we
  could argue that the whole notion of machine code quine is nonsense.
  No machine code quine can exist because there is no source code to
  produce as output.
</p>
<p>
  However, we could also argue that the machine code is the input for
  the CPU that the CPU fetches, decodes, and converts to a sequence of
  state changes in the CPU.  If we define a machine code quine to be a
  machine code program that writes its own bytes, then we could say
  that we have a machine code quine here.
</p>
<p>
  Let us now entertain the thought that our 12-byte program is indeed
  a machine code quine.  Now we have a new conundrum.  Is it a proper
  quine?  This program reads its own bytes from memory and writes
  them.  Does that make it a cheating quine?  What would a proper
  quine written in pure machine code even look like?  If we look at
  the shell script quine above, we see that it contains parts of the
  executable part of the script code embedded in a string as data.
  Then we format the string cleverly to produce a new string that
  looks exactly like the entire shell script.  It is a common pattern
  followed in many quines.  The quine does not read its own code but
  it reads some data defined by the code and formats that data to look
  like its own code.  However, in pure machine code like this the
  lines between data and code are blurred.  Even if we try to keep the
  bytes we want to read at a separate place in the memory and treat it
  like data, they would look exactly like machine instructions, so one
  might wonder if there is any point in trying to make a machine quine
  that does not read its own bytes.  Nevertheless the next section
  shows how to accomplish this.
</p>
<h2 id="proper-quines">Proper Quines</h2>
<p>
  If the thought of a machine code quine program reading its own bytes
  from the memory makes you uncomfortable, here is an adapation of the
  previous program that keeps the machine instructions to be executed
  separate from the data bytes to be read by the program.
</p>
<pre>
<code>fc b3 02 b1 14 be 14 01 ac 92 b4 02 cd 21 e2 f8 4b 75 f0 c3
fc b3 02 b1 14 be 14 01 ac 92 b4 02 cd 21 e2 f8 4b 75 f0 c3</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Here is how we can demonstrate this 40-byte program:
</p>
<pre>
<code>echo fc b3 02 b1 14 be 14 01 ac 92 b4 02 cd 21 e2 f8 4b 75 f0 c3 | xxd -r -p &gt; foo.com
echo fc b3 02 b1 14 be 14 01 ac 92 b4 02 cd 21 e2 f8 4b 75 f0 c3 | xxd -r -p &gt;&gt; foo.com
dosbox -c 'MOUNT C .' -c 'C:\FOO &gt; C:\OUT.COM' -c 'EXIT'
diff foo.com OUT.COM</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Here is the disassembly:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>ndisasm -o 0x100 foo.com</kbd>
00000100  FC                cld
00000101  B302              mov bl,0x2
00000103  B114              mov cl,0x14
00000105  BE1401            mov si,0x114
00000108  AC                lodsb
00000109  92                xchg ax,dx
0000010A  B402              mov ah,0x2
0000010C  CD21              int 0x21
0000010E  E2F8              loop 0x108
00000110  4B                dec bx
00000111  75F0              jnz 0x103
00000113  C3                ret

00000119  BE1401            mov si,0x114
0000011C  AC                lodsb
0000011D  92                xchg ax,dx
0000011E  B402              mov ah,0x2
00000120  CD21              int 0x21
00000122  E2F8              loop 0x11c
00000124  4B                dec bx
00000125  75F0              jnz 0x117
00000127  C3                ret</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  The first 20 bytes is the executable part of the program.  The next
  20 bytes is the data read by the program.  The executable bytes are
  identical to the data bytes.  The executable part of the program has
  an outer loop that iterates twice.  In each iteration, it reads the
  data bytes and writes them to standard output.  Therefore, in two
  iterations of the outer loop, it writes the data bytes twice.  In
  this manner, the output is identical to the program itself.
</p>
<p>
  Here is another simpler 32-byte quine based on this approach:
</p>
<pre>
<code>b8 23 09 fe c0 a2 20 01 ba 10 01 cd 21 cd 21 c3
b8 23 09 fe c0 a2 20 01 ba 10 01 cd 21 cd 21 c3</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Here are the commands to demostrate this quine:
</p>
<pre>
<code>echo b8 23 09 fe c0 a2 20 01 ba 10 01 cd 21 cd 21 c3 | xxd -r -p &gt; foo.com
echo b8 23 09 fe c0 a2 20 01 ba 10 01 cd 21 cd 21 c3 | xxd -r -p &gt;&gt; foo.com
dosbox -c 'MOUNT C .' -c 'C:\FOO &gt; C:\OUT.COM' -c 'EXIT'
diff foo.com OUT.COM</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Here is the disassembly:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>ndisasm -o 0x100 foo.com</kbd>
00000100  B82309            mov ax,0x923
00000103  FEC0              inc al
00000105  A22001            mov [0x120],al
00000108  BA1001            mov dx,0x110
0000010B  CD21              int 0x21
0000010D  CD21              int 0x21
0000010F  C3                ret
00000110  B82309            mov ax,0x923
00000113  FEC0              inc al
00000115  A22001            mov [0x120],al
00000118  BA1001            mov dx,0x110
0000011B  CD21              int 0x21
0000011D  CD21              int 0x21
0000011F  C3                ret</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  This example too has two parts.  The first half has the executable
  bytes and the second half has the data bytes.  Both parts are
  identical.  This example sets AH to 9 in the first instruction and
  then later uses <code>int 0x21</code> to invoke the DOS service that
  prints a dollar-terminated string beginning at the address specifed
  in DS:DX.  When a .COM program starts, DS already points to the
  current code segment, so we don't have to set it explicitly.  The
  dollar symbol has an ASCII code of 0x24 (decimal 36).  We need to be
  careful about not having this value anywhere within the the data
  bytes or this DOS function would prematurely stop printing our data
  bytes as soon as it encounters this value.  That is why we set AL to
  0x23 in the first instruction, then increment it to 0x24 in the
  second instruction, and then copy this value to the end of the data
  bytes in the third instruction.  Finally, we execute <code>int
  0x21</code> twice to write the data bytes twice to standard output,
  so that the output matches the program itself.
</p>
<p>
  While both these programs take care not to read the same memory
  region that is being executed by the CPU, the data bytes they read
  look exactly like the executable bytes.  This is what I meant when I
  mentioned earlier that the lines between code and data are blurred
  in an exercise like this.  This is why I don't really see a point in
  keeping the executable bytes separate from the data bytes while
  writing machine code quines.
</p>
<h2 id="a-note-on-dos-services">A Note on DOS Services</h2>
<p>
  The self-printing programs presented above use <code>int 0x21</code>
  which offers DOS services that support various input/output
  functions.  In the first two programs, we selected the function to
  write a character to standard output by setting AH to 2 before
  invoking this software interrupt.  In the next program, we selected
  the function to write a dollar-terminated string to standard output
  by setting AH to 9.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>ret</code> instruction in the end too relies on DOS
  services.  When a .COM program starts, the register SP contains
  0xfffe.  The stack memory locations at offset 0xfffe and 0xffff
  contain 0x00 and 0x00, respectively.  Further, the memory address at
  offset 0x0000 contains the instruction <code>int 0x20</code> which
  is a DOS service that terminates the program.  As a result,
  executing the <code>ret</code> instruction pops 0x0000 off the stack
  at 0xfffe and loads it into IP.  This results in the
  instruction <code>int 0x20</code> at offset 0x0000 getting executed.
  This instruction terminates the program and returns to DOS.
</p>
<p>
  Relying on DOS services gives us a comfortable environment to work
  with.  In particular, DOS implements the notion of <em>standard
  output</em> which lets us redirect standard output to a file.  This
  lets us conveniently compare the original program file and the
  output file with the <code>FC</code> command and confirm that they
  are identical.
</p>
<p>
  But one might wonder if we could avoid relying on DOS services
  completely and still write a program that prints its own bytes to
  screen.  We definitely can.  We could write directly to video memory
  at address 0xb800:0x0000 and show the bytes of the program on
  screen.  We could also forgo DOS completely and let BIOS load our
  program from the boot sector and execute it.  The next two sections
  discuss these things.
</p>
<h2 id="writing-to-video-memory-directly">Writing to Video Memory Directly</h2>
<p>
  Here is an example of an 18-byte self-printing program that writes
  directly to the video memory at address 0xb800:0x0000.
</p>
<pre><code>fc b4 b8 8e c0 31 ff b1 12 b4 0a ac ab e2 fc f4 eb fd</code></pre>
<p>
  Here are the commands to create and run this program:
</p>
<pre>
<code>echo fc b4 b8 8e c0 31 ff b1 12 b4 0a ac ab e2 fc f4 eb fd | xxd -r -p &gt; foo.com
dosbox foo.com</code>
</pre>
<p>
  With the default code page active, i.e., with code page 437 active,
  the program should display an output that looks approximately like
  the following and halt:
</p>
<pre><samp>&#x207F;&#x2524;&#x2555;&#xC4;&#x2514;&#x31;&#xA0;&#x2592;&#x2195;&#x2524;&#x25D9;&#xBC;&#xBD;&#x393;&#x207F;&#x2320;&#x3B4;&#xB2;</samp></pre>
<p>
  Now of course this type of output looks gibberish but there is a
  quick and dirty way to confirm that this output indeed represents
  the bytes of our program.  We can use the <code>TYPE</code> command
  of DOS to print the program and check if the symbols that appear in
  its output seem consistent with the output above.  Here is an
  example:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>C:\&gt;<kbd>TYPE FOO.COM</kbd>
&#x207F;&#x2524;&#x2555;&#xC4;&#x2514;&#x31;&#xA0;&#x2592;&#x2195;&#x2524;
          &#xBC;&#xBD;&#x393;&#x207F;&#x2320;&#x3B4;&#xB2;
C:\&gt;</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  This output looks very similar to the previous one except that the
  byte value 0x0a is rendered as a line break in this output whereas
  in the previous output this byte value is represented as a circle in
  a box.  This method of visually inspecting the output would not have
  worked very well if there were any control characters such as
  backspace or carriage return that result in characters being erased
  in the displayed output.
</p>
<p>
  A proper way to verify that the output of the program represents the
  bytes of the program would be to take each symbol from the output of
  the program, then look it up in a chart for code page 437, and
  confirm that the byte value of each symbol matches each byte value
  that makes the program.  Here is one such chart that approximates
  the symbols in code page 437 with Unicode
  symbols: <a href="code/cp437/cp437.html">cp437.html</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Here is the disassembly of the above program:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>ndisasm -o 0x100 foo.com</kbd>
00000100  FC                cld
00000101  B4B8              mov ah,0xb8
00000103  8EC0              mov es,ax
00000105  31FF              xor di,di
00000107  B112              mov cl,0x12
00000109  B40A              mov ah,0xa
0000010B  AC                lodsb
0000010C  AB                stosw
0000010D  E2FC              loop 0x10b
0000010F  F4                hlt
00000110  EBFD              jmp short 0x10f</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  This program sets ES to 0xb800 and DI to 0.  Thus ES:DI points to
  the video memory at address 0xb800:0x0000.  DS:SI points to the
  first instruction of this program by default.  Further AH is set to
  0xa.  This is used to specify the colour attribute of the text to be
  displayed on screen.  Each iteration of the loop in this program
  loads a byte of the program and writes it along with the colour
  attribute to video memory.  The <code>lodsb</code> instruction loads
  a byte of the program from the memory address specified by DS:SI
  into AL and increments SI by 1.  AH is already set to 0xa.  The
  value 0xa (binary 00001010) here specifies black as the background
  colour and bright green as the foreground colour.
  The <code>stosw</code> instruction stores a word from AX to the
  memory address specified by ES:DI and increments DI by 2.  In this
  manner, the byte in AL and its colour attribute in AH gets copied to
  the video memory.
</p>
<p>
  Once again, if you are not happy about the program reading its own
  executable bytes, we can keep the bytes we read separate from the
  bytes the CPU executes.  Here is a 54-byte program that does this:
</p>
<pre>
<code>fc b3 02 b4 b8 8e c0 31 ff be 1b 01 b9 1b 00 b4
0a ac ab e2 fc 4b 75 f1 f4 eb fd fc b3 02 b4 b8
8e c0 31 ff be 1b 01 b9 1b 00 b4 0a ac ab e2 fc
4b 75 f1 f4 eb fd</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Here is how we can create and run this program:
</p>
<pre>
<code>echo fc b3 02 b4 b8 8e c0 31 ff be 1b 01 b9 1b 00 b4 | xxd -r -p &gt; foo.com
echo 0a ac ab e2 fc 4b 75 f1 f4 eb fd fc b3 02 b4 b8 | xxd -r -p &gt;&gt; foo.com
echo 8e c0 31 ff be 1b 01 b9 1b 00 b4 0a ac ab e2 fc | xxd -r -p &gt;&gt; foo.com
echo 4b 75 f1 f4 eb fd | xxd -r -p &gt;&gt; foo.com
dosbox foo.com</code>
</pre>
<p>
  With code page 437 active, the output should look approximately like

  We can clearly see in this output that the first 27 bytes of output
  are identical to the next 27 bytes of the output.  Like the proper
  quines discussed earlier, this one too has two halves that are
  identical to each other.  The executable code in the first half
  reads the data bytes from the second half and prints the data bytes
  twice so that the output bytes is an exact copy of all 54 bytes in
  the program.  Here is the disassembly:

  This disassembly is rather long but we can clearly see that the
  bytes from offset 0x100 to offset 0x11a are identical to the bytes
  from offset 0x11b to 0x135.  These are the bytes we see in the
  output of the program too.
</p>
<h2 id="boot-program">Boot Program</h2>
<p>
  The 32-byte program below writes itself to video memory when
  executed from the boot sector:
</p>
<pre><code>ea 05 7c 00 00 fc b8 00 b8 8e c0 8c c8 8e d8 31
ff be 00 7c b9 20 00 b4 0a ac ab e2 fc f4 eb fd</code></pre>
<p>
  We can create a boot image that contains these bytes, write it to
  the boot sector of a drive and boot an IBM PC compatible computer
  with it.  On booting, this program prints its own bytes on the
  screen.
</p>
<p>
  On a Unix or Linux system, the following commands can be used to
  create a boot image with the above program:
</p>
<pre>
<code>echo ea 05 7c 00 00 fc b8 00 b8 8e c0 8c c8 8e d8 31 | xxd -r -p &gt; boot.img
echo ff be 00 7c b9 20 00 b4 0a ac ab e2 fc f4 eb fd | xxd -r -p &gt;&gt; boot.img
echo 55 aa | xxd -r -p | dd seek=510 bs=1 of=boot.img</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Now we can test this boot image using DOSBox with the following
  command:
</p>
<pre><code>dosbox -c cls -c 'boot boot.img'</code></pre>
<p>
  We can also test this image using QEMU x86 system emulator as
  follows:
</p>
<pre><code>qemu-system-i386 -fda boot.img</code></pre>
<p>
  We could also write this image to the boot sector of an actual
  physical storage device, such as a USB flash drive, and then boot
  the computer with it.  Here is an example command that writes the
  boot image to the drive represented by the device
  path <code>/dev/sdx</code>.
</p>
<pre><code>cp a.img /dev/sdx</code></pre>
<p>
  <em>
    CAUTION: You need to be absolutely sure of the device path of the
    device being written to.  The device path <code>/dev/sdx</code> is
    only an example here.  If the boot image is written to the wrong
    device, access to the data on that would be lost.
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  On testing this boot image with an emulator or a real computer, the
  output should look approximately like this:
</p>
<pre><samp>&#x3A9;&#x2663;&#x7C;&#x20;&#x20;&#x207F;&#x2555;&#x20;&#x2555;&#xC4;&#x2514;&#xEE;&#x255A;&#xC4;&#x256A;&#x31;&#xA0;&#x255B;&#x20;&#x7C;&#x2563;&#x20;&#x20;&#x2524;&#x25D9;&#xBC;&#xBD;&#x393;&#x207F;&#x2320;&#x3B4;&#xB2;</samp></pre>
<p>
  This looks like gibberish, however every symbol in the above output
  corresponds to a byte of the program mentioned earlier.  For
  example, the first symbol (omega) represents the byte value 0xea,
  the second symbol (club) represents the byte value 0x05, and so on.
  The chart at <a href="code/cp437/cp437.html">cp437.html</a> can be
  used to confirm that every symbol in the output indeed represents
  every byte of the program.

<p>
  Here is the disassembly of the program:

  The ellipsis in the end represents the remainder of the bytes that
  contains zeroes and the boot sector magic bytes 0x55 and 0xaa in the
  end.  They have been omitted here for the sake of brevity.
</p>
<p>
  When a computer boots, the BIOS reads the boot sector code from the
  first sector of the boot device into the memory at physical address
  0x7c00 and jumps to this address.  Most BIOS implementations jump to
  0x0000:0x7c00 but there are some implementations that jump to
  0x07c0:0x0000 instead.  Both these jumps are jumps to the same
  physical address 0x7c00 but this difference poses a problem for us
  because the offsets in our program depend on which jump the BIOS
  executed.  In order to ensure that our program can run with both
  types of BIOS implementations, we use a popular trick of having the
  first instruction of our program execute a jump to address
  0x0000:0x7c05 in order to reach the second instruction.  This sets
  the register CS to 0 and IP to 0x7c05 and we don't have to worry
  about the differences between BIOS implementations anymore.  We can
  now pretend as if a BIOS implementation that jumps to 0x0000:0x7c00
  is going to load our program.
</p>
<p>
  The remainder of the program is similar to the one in the previous
  section.  However, there are some small but important differences.
  While the DOS environment guarantees that AH and CH are initialised
  to 0 when a .COM program starts, the BIOS offers no such guarantee
  while loading and executing a boot program.  This is why we use the
  registers AX and CX (as opposed to only AH and CL) in
  the <code>mov</code> instructions to initialise them.  Similarly,
  while DOS initialises SI to 0x100 when a .COM program starts, for a
  boot program, we set the register SI ourselves.
</p>
<p>
  If you feel uncomfortable about calling the above program a quine
  because it reads its own bytes from the memory, we could have the
  program read the bytes it needs to print from a separate place in
  memory.  We do not execute these bytes.  We only read them and copy
  them to video memory.  The following 76-byte program does this:
</p>
<pre>
<code>ea 05 7c 00 00 fc bb 02 00 b8 00 b8 8e c0 8c c8
8e d8 31 ff be 26 7c b9 26 00 b4 0a ac ab e2 fc
4b 75 f1 f4 eb fd ea 05 7c 00 00 fc bb 02 00 b8
00 b8 8e c0 8c c8 8e d8 31 ff be 26 7c b9 26 00
b4 0a ac ab e2 fc 4b 75 f1 f4 eb fd</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Here is how we can create a boot image with this:
</p>
<pre>
<code>echo ea 05 7c 00 00 fc bb 02 00 b8 00 b8 8e c0 8c c8 | xxd -r -p &gt; boot.img
echo 8e d8 31 ff be 26 7c b9 26 00 b4 0a ac ab e2 fc | xxd -r -p &gt;&gt; boot.img
echo 4b 75 f1 f4 eb fd ea 05 7c 00 00 fc bb 02 00 b8 | xxd -r -p &gt;&gt; boot.img
echo 00 b8 8e c0 8c c8 8e d8 31 ff be 26 7c b9 26 00 | xxd -r -p &gt;&gt; boot.img
echo b4 0a ac ab e2 fc 4b 75 f1 f4 eb fd | xxd -r -p &gt;&gt; boot.img
echo 55 aa | xxd -r -p | dd seek=510 bs=1 of=boot.img</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Here are the commands to test this boot image:
</p>
<pre><code>dosbox -c cls -c 'boot boot.img'
qemu-system-i386 -fda boot.img</code></pre>
<p>
  The output should look like this:
</p>

  This program has two identical halves.  The first half from offset
  0x7c00 to offset 0x7c25 are executable bytes.  The second half from
  offset 0x7c26 to 0x7c4b are the data bytes read by the executable
  bytes.  The executable part of the code has an outer loop that uses
  the register BX as the counter variable.  It sets BX to 2 so that
  the outer loop iterates twice.  In each iteration, it reads data
  bytes from the second half of the program and prints them.  The code
  to read bytes and print them is very similar to our earlier program.
  Since the data bytes in the second half are identical to the
  executable bytes in the first half, printing the data bytes twice
  amounts to printing all bytes of the program.
</p>
<p>
  While this program does avoid reading the bytes that the CPU
  executes, the data bytes look exactly like the executable bytes.
  Although I do not see any point in trying to avoid reading
  executable bytes in an exercise like, this program serves as an
  example of a self-printing boot program that does not execute the
  bytes it reads.
</p>
