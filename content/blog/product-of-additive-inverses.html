  A negative number multiplied by another negative number results in a
  positive number.  Most of us learnt this rule during our primary or
  secondary school years.  'Negative times negative equals positive'
  was a phrase drummed into us during mathematics lessons.  In this
  article, we will prove this rule &mdash; not just for numbers, but
  for any algebraic structure that, in a general sense, behaves
  somewhat like numbers.

<h2 id="illustration">Illustration</h2>
<p>
  Let us begin with a quick illustration that shows why the product of
  two negative numbers must be positive for arithmetic to make sense.
  Consider

  \[
    7 \times 8 = 56.
  \]

  The above equation can also be written as

  \[
    (10 - 3) \times (10 - 2) = 56.
  \]

  Using the distributive property of multiplication over subtraction,
  we get

  \[
    (10 - 3) \times 10 + (10 - 3) \times (-2) = 56.
  \]

  Using the distributive property again, we have

  \[
    10 \times 10 + (-3) \times 10 + 10 \times (-2) + (-3) \times (-2) = 56.
  \]

  Now, we will take it for granted that a positive times a negative is
  negative.  We will prove all of this rigorously later, but for now,
  we are just working through an illustration, so we will accept that
  rule and see where it leads.  The equation becomes:

  \[
    100 + (-30) + (-20) + (-3) \times (-2) = 56.
  \]

  Adding the first three terms gives

  \[
    50 + (-3) \times (-2) = 56.
  \]

  Subtracting \( 50 \) from both sides, we get

  \[
    (-3) \times (-2) = 6.
  \]

  What we have seen here is that if we accept \( 7 \times 8 = 56 \),
  and that positive times negative gives a negative result, then we
  must also accept that \( (-3) \times (-2) = 6 \).

<h2 id="ring-axioms">Ring Axioms</h2>
<p>
  From this section onwards, we take a rigorous approach.  We want to
  show that the rule 'negative times negative equals positive' holds,
  in a general sense, for any set of elements that share certain
  properties with numbers.  As it turns out, these elements do not
  need to possess all the properties of complex numbers, real numbers,
  or even rational numbers.  In fact, if they satisfy a small and
  specific set of properties held by the integers, then the rule still
  holds.  These properties are known as the <em>ring axioms</em>.
</p>
<p>
  A ring is an algebraic structure consisting of a set \( R \) with
  two binary operations \( + \) and \( \cdot \), called addition and
  multiplication respectively, satisfying the following axioms:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Associativity of addition:</strong> For all \( a, b, c
      \in R \), we have \( a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c \).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Commutativity of addition:</strong> For all \( a, b \in
      R \), we have \( a + b = b + a \).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Additive identity:</strong> There exists an element \( 0
      \in R \) such that for all \( a \in R \), we have \( a + 0 = a =
      0 + a \).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Additive inverse:</strong> For each \( a \in R \), there
      exists an element \( -a \in R \) such that \( a + (-a) = 0 =
      (-a) + a \).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Associativity of multiplication:</strong> For all \( a,
      b, c \in R \), we have \( a \cdot (b \cdot c) = (a \cdot b)
      \cdot c \).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Left distributivity of multiplication over
      addition:</strong> For all \( a, b, c \in R \), we have \( a
      \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) + (a \cdot c) \).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Right distributivity of multiplication over
      addition:</strong> For all \( a, b, c \in R \), we have \( (b +
      c) \cdot a = (b \cdot a) + (c \cdot a) \).
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Note that we do not assume that the ring contains multiplicative
  identity, nor do we assume that multiplication is commutative.  Many
  familiar types of numbers form rings.  For example, the set of
  integers forms a ring with the usual addition and multiplication
  operations.  The sets of rational numbers, real numbers, and complex
  numbers satisfy the ring axioms too.
</p>
<p>
  Rings need not consist of numbers; they may contain elements of any
  type.  As long as a set of elements, together with suitable addition
  and multiplication operations, satisfies the seven axioms above, it
  forms a ring.  For example, the set of all polynomials in the
  indeterminate \( t \) with coefficients in some ring \( R \) forms a
  ring under the usual addition and multiplication of polynomials.
  Such a ring is called a <em>polynomial ring</em> and it is denoted
  \( R[t] \).
</p>
<h2 id="closure-properties">Closure Properties</h2>
<p>
  Some texts include the following additional axioms for the closure
  properties of a ring:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Closure under addition:</strong> For all
      \( a, b \in R \), we have \( a + b \in R \).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Closure under multiplication:</strong> For all \( a, b
      \in R \), we have \( a \cdot b \in R \).
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  However, stating these axioms explicitly is usually considered
  redundant because a binary operation is closed by definition.  A
  binary operation \( \circ \) on a set \( M \) is defined to be a
  function

  \[
    \circ : M \times M \to M; \quad (a, b) \mapsto a \circ b.
  \]

  This definition automatically implies the closure property, since
  the domain and codomain are the same.  The addition and
  multiplication operations on a ring \( R \) may be defined as

  \begin{align*}
        + &amp;: R \times R \to R; \quad (a, b) \mapsto a + b, \\
    \cdot &amp;: R \times R \to R; \quad (a, b) \mapsto a \cdot b.
  \end{align*}

  These definitions imply that a ring is closed under addition and
  multiplication.  In practice, while deciding if some set \( R \)
  forms a ring, we should always verify that the addition and
  multiplication operations indeed have \( R \) as the codomain to
  confirm that the closure property holds.

<p id="theorem-1">
  <strong>Theorem 1.</strong>
  <em>
    Let \( R \) be a ring with \( + \) and \( \cdot \) operations.
    Then for all \( a \in R \), we have

    \[
      -(-a) = a.
    \]
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Proof.</em> This result follows directly from the additive
  inverse axiom.  First, observe that

  \[
    a + (-a) = 0.
  \]

  Therefore \( a \) is an additive inverse of \( -a \), i.e.,

  \[
    -(-a) = a.
  \]

  This completes the proof.
</p>
<p>
  Notice that this proof does not involve the multiplication operation
  of a ring at all.  In fact, it holds true in a more general
  algebraic structure known as a <em>group</em>, which requires only a
  binary operation with associativity, an identity element, and
  inverses.  A ring, under addition, is also a group.  Since the proof
  relies solely on these additive group properties, this theorem holds
  for all groups.  However, for brevity, and to avoid introducing
  group axioms separately, I have stated and proved this theorem in
  the context of rings.
</p>
<p>
  It is also worth noting that the additive inverse is unique in a
  ring (as well as in any group), but since this fact is not needed
  for later results, its proof has been omitted.  Even if,
  hypothetically, there were two distinct additive identities, \( 0 \)
  and \( 0' \), in a ring (there are not, of course), the arguments
  below would still hold if we simply focus on \( 0 \).

<h2 id="multiplication-by-zero">Multiplication by Zero</h2>
<p id="theorem-2">
  <strong>Theorem 2.</strong>
  <em>
    Let \( R \) be a ring with \( + \) and \( \cdot \) operations.  Then
    for all \( a \in R \), we have

    \[
      a \cdot 0 = 0 \cdot a = 0.
    \]
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Proof.</em> Using the additive identity axiom, we get

  \[
    0 + 0 = 0.
  \]

  Multiplying both sides on the left by \( a \), we get

  \[
    a \cdot (0 + 0) = a \cdot 0.
  \]

  Using the left distributivity axiom, we get

  \[
    a \cdot 0 + a \cdot 0 = a \cdot 0.
  \]

  Let \( b = a \cdot 0 \).  Then

  \[
    b + b = b.
  \]

  Since a ring is closed under multiplication, \( b \in R \).  By the
  additive inverse axiom, there exists \( -b \in R \) such that \( b +
  (-b) = 0 \).  Adding \( -b \) to both sides of the above equation,
  we get

  \[
    (b + b) + (-b) = b + (-b).
  \]

  By associativity of addition in a ring, we get

  \[
    b + (b + (-b)) = b + (-b).
  \]

  Since \( b + (-b) = 0 \), the above equation becomes

  \[
    b + 0 = 0.
  \]

  By the additive identity axiom, we get

  \[
    b = 0.
  \]

  Since \( b = a \cdot 0 \), the above equation may be written as

  \[
    a \cdot 0 = 0.
  \]

  A similar argument shows that

  \[
    0 \cdot a = 0.
  \]

  This completes the proof.

  <strong>Theorem 3.</strong>
  <em>
    Let \( R \) be a ring with \( + \) and \( \cdot \) operations.
    Then for all \( a, b \in R \), we have

    \[
      a \cdot (-b) = (-a) \cdot b = -(a \cdot b).
    \]
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Proof.</em> Using the left distributivity and additive inverse
  properties of a ring along with <a href="#theorem-2">Theorem 2</a>,
  we get

  \[
    a \cdot b + a \cdot (-b)
    = a \cdot (b + (-b))
    = a \cdot 0
    = 0.
  \]

  Therefore \( a \cdot (-b) \) is an additive inverse of
  \( a \cdot b \), i.e.,

  \[
    -(a \cdot b) = a \cdot (-b).
  \]

  Similarly

  \[
    a \cdot b + (-a) \cdot b
    = (a + (-a)) \cdot b
    = 0 \cdot b
    = 0
  \]

  and thus

  \[
    -(a \cdot b) = (-a) \cdot b.

  This completes the proof.

  <strong>Theorem 4.</strong>
  <em>
    Let \( R \) be a ring with \( + \) and \( \cdot \) operations.  Then
    for all \( a, b \in R \), we have

    \[
      (-a) \cdot (-b) = a \cdot b.
    \]
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Proof.</em>
  From <a href="#theorem-3">Theorem 3</a>, we know that

  \[
    a \cdot (-b) = -(a \cdot b).
  \]

  Substituting \( a \) with \( -a \), we get

  \[
    (-a) \cdot (-b) = -((-a) \cdot b).
  \]

  Again by <a href="#theorem-3">Theorem 3</a>, we have \( (-a) \cdot b
  = -(a \cdot b) \).  Substituting this in the above equation, we
  obtain

  \[
    (-a) \cdot (-b) = -(-(a \cdot b)).
  \]

  Now using <a href="#theorem-1">Theorem 1</a>, the right-hand side
  becomes \( a \cdot b \), so we get

  \[
    (-a) \cdot (-b) = a \cdot b.
  \]

  This completes the proof.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  Theorems 1 to 4 establish certain algebraic properties that hold in
  any ring.  Although these results were proven abstractly for rings,
  they reflect properties we are already familiar with from our
  experience with numbers.  For example, in the ring of integers, we
  observe \( -(-2) = 2 \) which is a specific case
  of <a href="#theorem-1">Theorem 1</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, <a href="#theorem-2">Theorem 2</a> confirms the
  well-known fact that multiplying any integer by \( 0 \) yields
  \( 0 \).  For example, \( 2 \cdot 0 = 0 \).
</p>
<p>
  Then <a href="#theorem-3">Theorem 3</a> implies the rule that
  multiplying a positive number by a negative number yields a negative
  result.  For example, \( 2 \cdot (-3) = -(2 \cdot 3) = -6 \).
</p>
<p>
  Finally, <a href="#theorem-4">Theorem 4</a> implies that the product
  of two negative numbers is positive.  For example, \( (-2) \cdot
  (-3) = 2 \cdot 3 = 6 \).
</p>
<p>
  These familiar results are not limited to the ring of integers.  The
  results hold in any ring, including polynomial rings, rings of
  integers modulo a fixed positive integer, and many other algebraic
  systems.  These results demonstrate how the ring axioms formalise
  familiar arithmetic rules within a more general algebraic framework.
