<p>
Let me start this post with a simple equation:
\[
  x(x - 2) = 3x.
\]
</p>

<p>
Let us first solve it in a <em>flawed</em> manner.
</p>

<p>
Dividing both sides by \( x \) we get

\[
  x - 2 = 3.
\]
</p>

<p>
Adding \( 2 \) to both sides we get

\[
  x = 5.
\]
</p>

<p>
Indeed, \( x = 5 \) is a solution of this equation. If we substitute
\( x \) with \( 5 \) in the equation we get \( 15 \) on both sides, so
it confirms that this solution holds good.
</p>

<p>
However, \( x = 0 \) is also a solution of this equation. If we
substitute \( x \) with \( 0, \) we get \( 0 \) on both sides. But we
did not get this solution when we solved the equation in the flawed
manner above. Why did we lose this solution?
</p>

<p>
We lost this solution in the step where we divided both sides by \( x. \)
In doing so, we made the wrong assumption that \( x \ne 0. \) If we
want to consider the possibility of \( x = 0 \) as a solution, then we
cannot divide both sides of the equation by \( x. \) Division by \( 0 \)
is undefined in arithmetic. This is why the typical way to solve
such an equation is to bring all terms involving \( x \) to one side of
the equation and then solve it. For example,

\begin{align*}
  x(x - 2) = 3x
  & \iff x(x - 2) - 3x = 0 \\
  & \iff x^2 - 2x - 3x = 0 \\
  & \iff x(x - 5) = 0 \\
  & \iff x \in \{ 0, 5 \}.
\end{align*}
</p>


<h2 id="mathematical-fallacy">Mathematical Fallacy</h2>

<p>
Often fallacies or spurious proofs of contradictions is formed by
sneaking such a division by \( 0 \) into the proof. Here is one I could
think of.
</p>

<p>
Let \( a = b. \) Then

\begin{align*}
  a + b = 2a
  & \iff a + b - 2b = 2a - 2b \\
  & \iff a - b = 2(a - b).
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>
Dividing both sides by \( a - b, \) we get
\[
  1 = 2.
\]
</p>

<p>
We arrived at this contradiction because we incorrectly divided both
sides of the equation by \( a - b \) even though \( a - b = 0. \)
</p>


<h2 id="differential-equation">Differential Equation</h2>

<p>
We need to be careful about division by zero while solving differential
equations too.
</p>

<p>
Consider this differential equation:

\[
  y' = x^2 y^2.
\]
</p>

<p>
Dividing both sides by \( y^2, \) the variables separate and we get

\[
  y^{-2} y' = x^2.
\]
</p>

<p>
Now solving this becomes a routine task. By solving this differential
equation, we get

\[
y^{-1} = \frac{x^3}{3} + c
\]

where \( c \) is the constant of integration. Taking the negative
reciprocal of both sides, we get

\[
y = \frac{-3}{x^3 + 3c} = \frac{-3}{x^3 + c'}.
\]

where \( c' = 3c. \)
</p>

<p>
This is indeed a valid solution of the differential equation. However,
we have lost a solution. The lost solution is \( y = 0. \) We can verify
that with \( y = 0, \) we get \( 0 \) on both sides of the differential
equation. We lost this solution by dividing both sides of the
differential equation by \( y^2. \)
</p>

<p>
Whenever we need to divide both sides of a differential equation by a
function to separate the variables, we also need to perform an
additional step of verifying whether the zero function is a solution of
the equation. In this case \( y = 0 \) is indeed a solution of the
differential equation.
</p>

<p>
In general, when we need to divide both sides of the equation by a
function of \( y, \) say \( f(y), \) to separate the variables, we need
to perform an additional step of verifying whether \( f(y) = 0 \) is a
solution of the differential equation.
