<!-- title: MathB.in Turns Ten -->
<!-- tag: Web, Technology -->
<p>
  On this day, ten years ago, <a href="https://mathb.in/">MathB.in</a>
  was released on the world wide web.  MathB.in is a web-based
  mathematics pastebin service that is used for sharing snippets of
  mathematical text with others.
  Visit <a href="https://mathb.in/">mathb.in</a> to see what it looks
  like and use it.  The source code is available
  at <a href="https://github.com/susam/mathb">github.com/susam/mathb</a>.

<h2 id="brief-history-mathematics-pastebins">A Brief History of Mathematics Pastebins</h2>
<p>
  MathB.in is the oldest mathematics pastebin that is still alive and
  serving its community of users.  It isn't the first mathematics
  pastebin though.  It's the second.  The first one was written by
  Mark A. Stratman and hosted at <em>mathbin.net</em> until 2020.  It
  was very popular in the <code>#math</code> and <code>#physics</code>
  channels on IRC networks between 2006 and 2013.  It did not have
  live preview but it used an actual LaTeX system in the backend for
  rendering mathematical formulas into images, so the output was of
  pretty good quality.  It served IRC users very well for sharing
  problems and solutions quickly with each other on IRC channels.
  Since late-2014, Mark's website began intermittently displaying a
  notice that the website was shutting down.  The notice replaced the
  actual pastebin on some days, so users were forced to look for
  alternatives.  MathB.in was already available on the web and popular
  among IRC users by then, so it turned out to be a good alternative.
  Mark's website disappeared sometime in late-2020.
</p>
<p>
  Another alternative to the first mathematics pastebin was Huy
  Nguyen's <em>texpaste.com</em>.  It was released on the web in
  September 2013.  I believe it was the third pastebin to be released
  on the web.  In fact, it was a bit more than a pastebin.  It allowed
  users to sign up for accounts and save their notes in their
  accounts.  It had some nifty widgets to click and automatically
  insert common LaTeX symbols instead of typing them out manually.  It
  had its own community of users.  However, it suffered from serious
  spam problems.  Searching for "texpaste.com" on Twitter shows how
  the service was being exploited by spammers to share dubious content
  and links several times every single day between December 2016 and
  February 2018.  Despite the spam problems, it continued to serve its
  genuine users for many years.  Finally, the website disappeared in
  2021 and has not returned since then.

<h2 id="story-of-mathbin">The Story of MathB.in</h2>
<p>
  MathB.in was born on Sunday, 25 March 2012, after a single night of
  furious coding.  The previous night, I happened to stumble
  upon <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/">math.stackexchange.com</a>
  and I noticed that it seemed to have decent LaTeX support.  As I
  dove deeper into the HTML source code of the pages of this website,
  I was surprised to see that the rendered LaTeX was not made of image
  files embedded into the web pages which used to be a prevalent
  practice in those days.  Instead, the mathematical formulas were
  rendered as text with quite complicated styling done with CSS to
  make the rendered mathematics formula look as good as a PDF rendered
  by an actual LaTeX system.  On further investigation I realised that
  this Stack Exchange website was
  using <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a> to produce
  high-quality typography from LaTeX code.  As a frequent participant
  in the <code>#math</code> channels on various IRC networks, I
  immediately realised that using MathJax could lead to a modern
  mathematics pastebin with live preview and beautiful mathematics
  rendering right within the web browser without requiring a LaTeX
  system in the backend.
</p>
<p>
  Thanks to that chance encounter with MathJax, I spent the rest of
  the Saturday night coding a new mathematics pastebin using MathJax
  and PHP.  After coding all through the night, registering a new
  domain name, and setting up a website, MathB.in was published early
  Sunday morning.  I shared the link to the website with some of my
  friends who were fond of sharing mathematics puzzles and solutions.
  I also
  <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/mathjax-users/c/_YAetB0gx2w/m/Xocb-aJOu4IJ">announced</a>
  its availability on the MathJax mailing list.  Since then word about
  my new website spread to various IRC communities and it soon became
  quite popular in mathematically-oriented channels.
</p>
<h2 id="source-code">Source Code</h2>
<p>
  The source code of MathB.in was originally written in PHP.  I
  gradually began releasing its source code part by part in November
  2013.  The first complete open source release of MathB.in was done
  in December 2013.
</p>
<p>
  The early source code of MathB.in was quite complicated and
  over-engineered.  I was young and naive.  Much like how toddlers and
  young kids like to play with miniature forms of real world objects
  like cars, trains, trucks, and kitchen sets, in my naivety, I had
  ended up creating a miniature form of the multiple levels of
  abstractions and complexity we see in the corporate world of
  software engineering.
</p>
<p>
  The thought of rewriting the software and simplifying it crossed my
  mind many times.  Incidentally, several years before writing
  MathB.in, I had stumbled upon the Lisp family of languages.  It was
  during a long layover at an airport in September 2007 that I decided
  to boot my laptop running Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 (Etch) and learn some
  Lisp programming.  I happened to have GNU CLISP 2.41 installed on
  it, so I fired it up and began learning Common Lisp.  A few months
  later I also dabbled in Scheme.  I found the sheer simplicity,
  beauty, and elegance of Lisp and Scheme to be fascinating.  But the
  thought of writing websites using Common Lisp did not occur to me
  until much later.
</p>
<p>
  At some point much later, I began rewriting MathB.in in Common Lisp
  while preserving its user interface and most of its behaviour.
  MathB.in no longer runs on PHP.  It has been rewritten in Common
  Lisp and the entire application code is now a single Lisp source
  code file.

<p>
  While the user interface and behaviour of MathB.in has remain
  largely the same as it was on its first day of release back in 2012,
  there have been some new additions to its feature set.  Support for
  GitHub Flavoured Markdown (GFM) has been added by popular demand.
  It now uses the <a href="https://github.com/susam/texme">TeXMe</a>
  renderer to more robustly parse a mix of Markdown and LaTeX.  A dark
  colour scheme has been added which is displayed on web browsers that
  are running on a desktop with dark colour scheme enabled.  The
  layout of the user interface elements are now responsive and adapt
  to small screen devices.
</p>
<p>
  Today MathB.in is used in various IRC channels for exchanging
  mathematics problems and solutions.  From the testimonials I have
  received so far, I know that it is also used by many teachers in
  schools and colleges to hand out problems, sample solutions, and
  notes to their students.  Occasionally I receive emails and messages
  from kind strangers on the Internet who tell me how useful MathB.in
  has been for them.  Running this project for a decade and knowing
  that it has been useful to many people has brought me joy.
