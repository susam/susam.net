<h2 id="skipping-over-a-function-call">Skipping Over a Function Call</h2>
<p>
  Here is a C puzzle that involves some analysis of the machine code
  generated from it followed by manipulation of the runtime stack.
  The solution to this puzzle is <em>implementation-dependent</em>.
  Here is the puzzle:
</p>
<div class="highlight">
<p>
  Consider this C code:
</p>
<pre>
<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void f()
{
}

int main()
{
    printf("1\n");
    f();
    printf("2\n");
    printf("3\n");
    return 0;
}</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Define the function <code>f()</code> such that the output of the
  above code is:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>1
3</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  Printing <code>3</code> in <code>f()</code> and exiting is not
  allowed as a solution.
</p>
</div>
<p>
  <em>If you want to think about this problem, this is a good time to
  pause and think about it.  There are spoilers ahead.</em>
</p>
<p>
  The solution essentially involves figuring out what code we can
  place in the body of <code>f()</code> such that it causes the
  program to skip over the machine code generated for
  the <code>printf("2\n")</code> operation.  I'll share two solutions
  for two different implementations:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    gcc 4.3.2 on 64-bit Debian 5.0.3 running on 64-bit Intel Core 2
    Duo.
  </li>
  <li>
    Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 on 32-bit Windows XP running on
    64-bit Intel Core 2 Duo.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="solution-for-gcc">Solution for GCC</h2>
<p>
  Let us first see step by step how I approached this problem for GCC.
  We add a statement <code>char a = 7;</code> to the function
  <code>f()</code>.  The code looks like this:
</p>
<pre>
<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void f()
{
    char a = 7;
}

int main()
{
    printf("1\n");
    f();
    printf("2\n");
    printf("3\n");
    return 0;
}</code>
</pre>
<p>
  There is nothing special about the number <code>7</code> here.  We
  just want to define a variable in <code>f()</code> and assign some
  value to it.
</p>
<p>
  Then we compile the code and analyse the machine code generated for
  <code>f()</code> and <code>main()</code> functions.

<p>
  When <code>main()</code> calls <code>f()</code>, the microprocessor
  saves the return address (where the control must return to after
  <code>f()</code> is executed) in stack.  The line at offset
  <samp>1d</samp> in the listing above for <code>main()</code> is the
  call to <code>f()</code>.  After <code>f()</code> is executed, the
  instruction at offset <samp>22</samp> is executed.  Therefore the
  return address that is saved on stack is the address at which the
  instruction at offset
  <samp>22</samp> would be present at runtime.
</p>
<p>
  The instructions at offsets <samp>22</samp> and <samp>27</samp> are
  the instructions for the <code>printf("2\n")</code> call.  These are
  the instructions we want to skip over.  In other words, we want to
  modify the return address in the stack from the address of the
  instruction at offset <samp>22</samp> to that of the instruction at
  offset <samp>2c</samp>.  This is equivalent to skipping 10 bytes
  (0x2c - 0x22 = 10) of machine code or adding 10 to the return
  address saved in the stack.
</p>
<p>
  Now how do we get hold of the return address saved in the stack when
  <code>f()</code> is being executed?  This is where the variable
  <code>a</code> we defined in <code>f()</code> helps.  The instruction
  at offset <samp>4</samp> is the instruction generated for
  assigning <code>7</code> to the variable <code>a</code>.
</p>
<p>
  From the knowledge of how microprocessor works and from the machine
  code generated for <code>f()</code>, we find that the following
  sequence of steps are performed during the call to <code>f()</code>:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    The microprocessor saves the return address by pushing the content
    of RIP (instruction pointer) register into the stack.
  </li>
  <li>
    The function <code>f()</code> pushes the content of the RBP (base
    pointer) register into the stack.
  </li>
  <li>
    The function <code>f()</code> copies the content of the RSP (stack
    pointer) register to the RBP register.
  </li>
  <li>
    The function <code>f()</code> stores the byte value <code>7</code>
    at the memory address specified by the content of RBP minus 1.
    This achieves the assignment of the value <code>7</code> to the
    variable <code>a</code>.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  After <code>7</code> is assigned to the variable <code>a</code>, the
  stack is in the following state:
</p>
<table class="grid center textcenter">
  <tr>
    <th>Address</th>
    <th>Content</th>
    <th>Size (in bytes)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>&amp;a + 5</code></td>
    <td>Return address (old RIP)</td>
    <td>8</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>&amp;a + 1</code></td>
    <td>Old base pointer (old RBP)</td>
    <td>8</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>&amp;a</code></td>
    <td>Variable <code>a</code></td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  If we add 9 to the address of the variable <code>a</code>, i.e.,
  <code>&amp;a</code>, we get the address where the return address is
  stored.  We saw earlier that if we increment this return address by
  10 bytes, it solves the problem.  Therefore here is the solution
  code:
</p>
<pre>
<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void f()
{
    char a;
    (&amp;a)[9] += 10;
}

int main()
{
    printf("1\n");
    f();
    printf("2\n");
    printf("3\n");
    return 0;
}</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Finally, we compile and run this code and confirm that the solution
  works fine:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>gcc overwrite.c &amp;&amp; ./a.out</kbd>

</pre>
<h2 id="solution-for-visual-studio">Solution for Visual Studio</h2>
<p>
  Now we will see another example solution, this time for Visual
  Studio 2005.
</p>
<p>
  Like before we define a variable <code>a</code> in <code>f()</code>.
  The code now looks like this:
</p>
<pre>
<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void f()
{
    char a = 7;
}

int main()
{
    printf("1\n");
    f();
    printf("2\n");
    printf("3\n");
    return 0;
}</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Then we compile the code and analyse the machine code generated from
  it.

  Just like in the previous <code>objdump</code> listing, in this
  listing too, the instruction at offset <code>4</code> shows where
  the variable <code>a</code> is allocated and the instructions at
  offsets <code>25</code>, <code>2A</code>, and <code>2F</code> show
  the instructions we want to skip, i.e., instead of returning to the
  instruction at offset <code>25</code>, we want the microprocessor to
  return to the instruction at offset <code>32</code>.  This involves
  skipping 13 bytes (0x32 - 0x25 = 13) of machine code.
</p>
<p>
  Unlike the previous <code>objdump</code> listing, in this listing we
  see that the Visual Studio I am using is a 32-bit on, so it
  generates machine code to use 32-bit registers like EBP, ESP, etc.
  Thus the stack looks like this after <code>7</code> is assigned to
  the variable
  <code>a</code>:
</p>
<table class="grid center textcenter">
  <tr>
    <th>Address</th>
    <th>Content</th>
    <th>Size (in bytes)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>&amp;a + 5</code></td>
    <td>Return address (old EIP)</td>
    <td>4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>&amp;a + 1</code></td>
    <td>Old base pointer (old EBP)</td>
    <td>4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>&amp;a</code></td>
    <td>Variable <code>a</code></td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  If we add 5 to the address of the variable <code>a</code>, i.e.,
  <code>&amp;a</code>, we get the address where the return address is
  stored.  Here is the solution code:
</p>
<pre>
<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void f()
{
    char a;
    (&amp;a)[5] += 13;
}

int main()
{
    printf("1\n");
    f();
    printf("2\n");
    printf("3\n");
    return 0;
}</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Finally, we compile and run this code and confirm that the solution
  works fine:

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  The machine code that the compiler generates for a given C code is
  highly dependent on the implementation of the compiler.  In the two
  examples above, we have two different solutions for two different
  compilers.
</p>
<p>
  Even with the same brand of compiler, the way it generates machine
  code for a given code may change from one version of the compiler to
  another.  Therefore, it is very likely that the above solution would
  not work on another system (such as your system) even if you use the
  same compiler that I am using in the examples above.
</p>
<p>
  However, we can arrive at the solution for an implementation of the
  compiler by determining what number to add to <code>&amp;a</code> to
  get the address where the return address is saved on stack and what
  number to add to this return address to make it point to the
  instruction we want to skip to after <code>f()</code> returns.
</p>
