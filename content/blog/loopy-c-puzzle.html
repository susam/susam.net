<h2 id="integer-underflow">Integer Underflow</h2>
<p>
  Let us talk a little bit about integer underflow and undefined
  behaviour in C before we discuss the puzzle I want to share in this
  post.
</p>
<pre>
<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 6; i--) {
        printf(".");
    }
    return 0;
}</code>
</pre>
<p>
  This code invokes undefined behaviour.  The value in variable
  <code>i</code> decrements to <code>INT_MIN</code> after
  <code>|INT_MIN|</code> iterations.  In the next iteration, there is a
  negative overflow which is undefined for signed integers in C.  On
  many implementations though, <code>INT_MIN - 1</code> wraps around
  to <code>INT_MAX</code>.  Since <code>INT_MAX</code> is not less than
  <code>6</code>, the loop terminates.  With such implementations, this
  code prints print <code>|INT_MIN| + 1</code> dots.  With 32-bit integers,
  that amounts to 2147483649 dots.  Here is one such example output:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>gcc -std=c89 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic foo.c &amp;&amp; ./a.out | wc -c</kbd>
2147483649</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  It is worth noting that the above behaviour is only one of the many
  possible ones.  The code invokes undefined behaviour and the ISO
  standard imposes no requirements on a specific implementation of the
  compiler regarding what the behaviour of such code should be.  For
  example, an implementation could also exploit the undefined
  behaviour to turn the loop into an infinite loop.  In fact, GCC does
  optimise it to an infinite loop if we compile the code with
  the <code>-O2</code> option.
</p>
<pre>
<samp><kbd># This never terminates!</kbd>
$ <kbd>gcc -O2 -std=c89 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic foo.c &amp;&amp; ./a.out</kbd></samp>
</pre>
<h2 id="puzzle">Puzzle</h2>
<p>
  Let us take a look at the puzzle now.
</p>
<div class="highlight">
<p>
  Add or modify exactly one operator in the following code such that
  it prints exactly 6 dots.
</p>
<pre>
<code>for (i = 0; i &lt; 6; i--) {
    printf(".");
}</code>
</pre>
</div>
<p>
  An obvious solution is to change <code>i--</code>
  to <code>i++</code>.
</p>
<pre>
<code>for (i = 0; i &lt; 6; i++) {
    printf(".");
}</code>
</pre>
<p>
  There are a few more solutions to this puzzle.  One of the solutions
  is very interesting.  We will discuss the interesting solution in
  detail below.
</p>
<h2 id="solutions">Solutions</h2>
<p>
  <em><strong>Update on 02 Oct 2011:</strong> The puzzle has been
  solved in the <a href="comments/loopy-c-puzzle.html">comments</a>
  section.  We will discuss the solutions now.  If you want to think
  about the problem before you see the solutions, this is a good time
  to pause and think about it.  There are spoilers ahead.</em>
</p>
<p>
  Here is a list of some solutions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>for (i = 0; i &lt; 6; i++)</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>for (i = 0; i &lt; 6; ++i)</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>for (i = 0; -i &lt; 6; i--)</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>for (i = 0; i + 6; i--)</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>for (i = 0; i ^= 6; i--)</code>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The last solution involving the bitwise XOR operation is not
  immediately obvious.  A little analysis is required to understand
  why it works.
</p>
<h2 id="generalisation">Generalisation</h2>
<p>
  Let us generalise the puzzle by replacing \( 6 \) in the loop with
  an arbitrary positive integer \( n \).  The loop in the last
  solution now becomes:
</p>
<pre>
<code>for (i = 0; i ^= n; i--) {
    printf(".");
}</code>
</pre>
<p>
  If we denote the value of the variable <code>i</code> set by the
  execution of <code>i ^= n</code> after \( k \) dots are printed as
  \( f(k) \), then

  \[
    f(k) =
      \begin{cases}
        0                       &amp; \text{if } k = 0, \\
        n \oplus (f(k - 1) - 1) &amp; \text{if } k &gt; 1
      \end{cases}
  \]

  where \( k \) is a nonnegative integer, \( n \) is a positive
  integer, and the symbol \( \oplus \) denotes bitwise XOR operation
  on two nonnegative integers.
</p>
<p>
  Note that \( f(0) \) represents the value of <code>i</code> set by
  the execution of <code>i ^= n</code> when no dots have been printed
  yet.
</p>
<p>
  If we can show that \( n \) is the least value of \( k \) for which
  \( f(k) = 0 \), it would prove that the loop terminates after
  printing \( n \) dots.
</p>
<p>
  We will see in the next section that for odd values of \( n \),

  \[
    f(k) =
      \begin{cases}
        n &amp; \text{if } k \text{ is even}, \\
        1 &amp; \text{if } k \text{ is odd}.
      \end{cases}
  \]

  Therefore there is no value of \( k \) for which \( f(k) = 0 \) when
  \( n \) is odd.  As a result, the loop never terminates when \( n \)
  is odd.
</p>
<p>
  We will then see that for even values of \( n \) and \( 0 \leq k
  \leq n \),

  \[
    f(k) = 0 \iff k = n.
  \]

  Therefore the loop terminates after printing \( n \) dots when
  \( n \) is even.
</p>
<h2 id="lemmas">Lemmas</h2>
<p>
  We will first prove a few lemmas about some interesting properties
  of the bitwise XOR operation.  We will then use it to prove the
  claims made in the previous section.
</p>
<!-- Lemma 1 -->
<p>
<strong>Lemma 1.</strong>
<em>
  For an odd positive integer \( n \),

  \[
    n \oplus (n - 1) = 1
  \]

  where the symbol \( \oplus \) denotes bitwise XOR operation on two
  nonnegative integers.
</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Proof.</em>  Let the binary representation of \( n \) be \( b_m
  \dots b_1 b_0 \) where \( m \) is a nonnegative integer and
  \( b_m \) represents the most significant nonzero bit of \( n \).
  Since \( n \) is an odd number, \( b_0 = 1 \).

  Thus \( n \) may be written as

  \[
    b_m \dots b_1 1.
  \]

  As a result \( n - 1 \) may be written as

  \[
    b_m \dots b_1 0.
  \]

  The bitwise XOR of both binary representations is \( 1 \).
</p>
<!-- Lemma 2 -->
<p>
  <strong>Lemma 2.</strong>
  <em>
    For a nonnegative integer \( n \),

    \[
      n \oplus 1 =
      \begin{cases}
      n + 1 &amp; \text{if } n \text{ is even}, \\
      n - 1 &amp; \text{if } n \text{ is odd}.
      \end{cases}
    \]

    where the symbol \( \oplus \) denotes bitwise XOR operation on two
    nonnegative integers.
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Proof.</em>  Let the binary representation of \( n \) be \( b_m
  \dots b_1 b_0 \) where \( m \) is a nonnegative integer and
  \( b_m \) represents the most significant nonzero bit of \( n \).
</p>
<p>
  If \( n \) is even, \( b_0 = 0 \).  In this case, \( n \) may be
  written as \( b_m \dots b_1 0 \).  Thus \( n \oplus 1 \) may be
  written as \( b_m \dots b_1 1 \).  Therefore \( n \oplus 1 = n + 1 \).
</p>
<p>
  If \( n \) is odd, \( b_0 = 1 \).  In this case, \( n \) may be
  written as \( b_m \dots b_1 1 \).  Thus \( n \oplus 1 \) may be
  written as \( b_m \dots b_1 0 \).  Therefore \( n \oplus 1 = n - 1 \).
</p>
<p>
  Note that for odd \( n \), lemma 1 can also be derived as a
  corollary of lemma 2 in this manner:

  \[
    k \oplus (k - 1)
    = k \oplus (k \oplus 1)
    = (k \oplus k) \oplus 1
    = 0 \oplus 1
    = 1.
  \]
</p>
<!-- Lemma 3 -->
<p>
  <strong>Lemma 3.</strong>
  <em>
    If \( x \) is an even nonnegative integer and \( y \) is an odd
    positive integer, then \( x \oplus y \) is odd, where the symbol
    \( \oplus \) denotes bitwise XOR operation on two nonnegative
    integers.
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Proof.</em>  Let the binary representation of \( x \) be \(
  b_{xm_x} \dots b_{x1} b_{x0} \) and that of \( y \) be \( b_{ym_y}
  \dots b_{y1} b_{y0} \) where \( m_x \) and \( m_y \) are nonnegative
  integers and \( b_{xm_x} \) and \( b_{xm_y} \) represent the most
  significant nonzero bits of \( x \) and \( y \), respectively.
</p>
<p>
  Since \( x \) is even, \( b_{x0} = 0 \).  Since \( y \) is odd, \(
  b_{y0} = 1 \).
</p>
<p>
  Let \( z = x \oplus y \) with a binary representation of \( b_{zm_z}
  \dots b_{z1} b_{z0} \) where \( m_{zm_z} \) is a nonnegative integer
  and \( b_{zm_z} \) is the most significant nonzero bit of \( z \).
</p>
<p>
  We get \( b_{z0} = b_{x0} \oplus b_{y0} = 0 \oplus 1 = 1 \).
  Therefore \( z \) is odd.
</p>
<h2 id="theorems">Theorems</h2>
<!-- Theorem 1 -->
<p>
<strong>Theorem 1.</strong>
<em>
  Let \( \oplus \) denote bitwise XOR operation on two nonnegative
  integers and

  \[
    f(k) =
    \begin{cases}
    n                        &amp; \text{if } n = 0, \\
    n \oplus (f(n - 1) - 1)  &amp; \text{if } n &gt; 1.
    \end{cases}
  \]

  where \( k \) is a nonnegative integer and \( n \) is an odd
  positive integer.  Then

  \[
    f(k) =
    \begin{cases}
    n &amp; \text{if } k \text{ is even}, \\
    1 &amp; \text{if } k \text{ is odd}.
    \end{cases}
  \]
</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Proof.</em>  This is a proof by mathematical induction.  We have
  \( f(0) = n \) by definition.  Therefore the base case holds good.
</p>
<p>
  Let us assume that \( f(k) = n \) for any even \( k \) (induction
  hypothesis).  Let \( k' = k + 1 \) and \( k'' = k + 2 \).
</p>
<p>
  If \( k \) is even, we get

  \begin{align*}
    f(k')  &amp; = n \oplus (f(k) - 1)  &amp;&amp; \text{(by definition)} \\
           &amp; = n \oplus (n - 1)     &amp;&amp; \text{(by induction hypothesis)} \\
           &amp; = 1                    &amp;&amp; \text{(by lemma 1)},\\
    f(k'') &amp; = n \oplus (f(k') - 1) &amp;&amp; \text{(by definition)} \\
           &amp; = n \oplus (1 - 1)     &amp;&amp; \text{(since \( f(k') = 1 \))} \\
           &amp; = n \oplus 0 \\
           &amp; = n.
  \end{align*}
</p>
<p>
  Since \( f(k'') = n \) and \( k'' \) is the next even number after
  \( k \), the induction step is complete.  The induction step shows
  that for every even \( k \), \( f(k) = n \) holds good.  It also
  shows that as a result of \( f(k) = n \) for every even \( k \), we
  get \( f(k') = 1 \) for every odd \( k' \).
</p>
<!-- Theorem 2 -->
<p>
  <strong>Theorem 2.</strong>
  <em>
    Let \( \oplus \) denote bitwise XOR operation on two nonnegative
    integers and

    \[
      f(k) =
        \begin{cases}
          n                        &amp; \text{if } n = 0, \\
          n \oplus (f(n - 1) - 1)  &amp; \text{if } n &gt; 1.
        \end{cases}
    \]

    where \( k \) is a nonnegative integer, \( n \) is an even
    positive integer, and \( 0 \leq k \leq n \).  Then

   \[
     f(k) = 0 \iff k = n.
   \]
</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Proof.</em>  We will first show by the principle of mathematical
  induction that for even \( k \), \( f(k) = n - k \).  We have \(
  f(0) = n \) by definition, so the base case holds good.  Now let us
  assume that \( f(k) = n - k \) holds good for any even \( k \) where
  \( 0 \leq k \leq n \) (induction hypothesis).
</p>
<p>
  Since \( n \) is even (by definition) and \( k \) is even (by
  induction hypothesis), \( f(k) = n - k \) is even.  As a result, \(
  f(k) - 1 \) is odd.  By lemma 3, we conclude that \( f(k + 1) = n
  \oplus (f(k) - 1) \) is odd.
</p>
<p>
  Now we perform the induction step as follows:

  \begin{align*}
    f(k + 2) &amp; = n \oplus (f(k + 1) - 1)
                     &amp;&amp; \text{(by definition)} \\
             &amp; = n \oplus (f(k + 1) \oplus 1)
                     &amp;&amp; \text{(by lemma 2 for odd \( n \))} \\
             &amp; = n \oplus ((n \oplus (f(k) - 1)) \oplus 1)
                     &amp;&amp; \text{(by definition)} \\
             &amp; = (n \oplus n ) \oplus ((f(k) - 1) \oplus 1)
                     &amp;&amp; \text{(by associativity of XOR)} \\
             &amp; = 0 \oplus ((f(k) - 1) \oplus 1) \\
             &amp; = (f(k) - 1) \oplus 1 \\
             &amp; = (f(k) - 1) - 1
                     &amp;&amp; \text{(from lemma 2 for odd \( n \))} \\
             &amp; = f(k) - 2 \\
             &amp; = n - k - 2
                     &amp;&amp; \text{(by induction hypothesis).}
  \end{align*}

  This completes the induction step and proves that \( f(k) = n - k \)
  for even \( k \) where \( 0 \leq k \leq n \).
</p>
<p>
  We have shown above that \( f(k) \) is even for every even \( k \)
  where \( 0 \leq k \leq n \) which results in \( f(k + 1) \) as odd
  for every odd \( k + 1 \).  This means that \( f(k) \) cannot be \(
  0 \) for any odd \( k \).  Therefore \( f(k) = 0 \) is possible only
  even \( k \).  Solving \( f(k) = n - k = 0 \), we conclude that \(
  f(k) = 0 \) if and only if \( k = n \).
