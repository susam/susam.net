  Nice work.  I was in shock when I saw the splash screen.  I had used
  IBM BASIC from July 1980 until Sept 1983, when I took a Pascal
  class.  I was taking Fortran on the mainframe, Cobol on the mini,
  and Pascal on a PC.  I had seen Logo on a Apple ][ but I was more
  interested in data processing.

  Wow, Flashback!  I too started with Logo.  I didn't know that it's
  related to Lisp.

  When I had Windows, I used
  <a href="http://dfendreloaded.sourceforge.net/">D-Fend Reloaded</a>
  to manage my DOS game library.  It has no updates since 2015 though.
  It was pretty good for installing and organizing games.  These days
  we can play them online directly.

  Have you tried streaming games in full screen mode?  For me it works
  in window mode only.

  I'm glad that the author thought to correct the aspect ratio for
  these captures.  That's the thing that bugs me about emulating old
  systems (almost always 'high resolution' PC screen modes); they tend
  to only want to display a pixel-accurate picture.  That's all well
  and good, but it's not visually accurate; it stretches out the
  artwork kind of like you're watching old 4:3 TV shows stretched to
  fit a 16:9 display.
