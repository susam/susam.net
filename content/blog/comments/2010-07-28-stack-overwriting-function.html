Good article. This is how buffer overflow is exploited. But I
guess, kernel provides some random stack alignment to prevent this.

I think you mean ASLR. On Linux, this can be turned off by running
<code>echo 0 &gt; /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space</code>. On
Windows, DEP can be turned off at <samp>Control Panel</samp> &rarr;
<samp>System</samp> &rarr; <samp>Advanced</samp> &rarr;
<samp>Performance</samp> &rarr; <samp>Settings</samp>, if I remember
correctly.
