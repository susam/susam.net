  The instructions in this article should work, but they're more
  complicated than necessary maybe. If you don't
  have <code>scp</code>, you can usually just do something like this:
</p>
<pre><code>ssh HOST cat remote_file &gt; local_file</code></pre>

  NRClark, I mention in the first two paragraphs of my blog post that
  the SSH gateway in between forbids execution of remote commands
  without a login shell, so your solution is not going to work in this
  environment.

<p>
  My solution in these cases:
</p>
<pre><code>ssh HOST tar cjf - /path/to/folder | tar xjf -</code></pre>
<p>
  Basically I ask ssh to execute tar on the remote host to create a
  compressed archive. ssh will output the archive contents on the
  local host; this data is then passed on to a local tar for
  extraction.

  This seems like a CTF trick. If I were faced with this problem, I
  would do an SSH local port forward, and then just <code>wget</code>
  the file, hosted locally with <code>python -m
  SimpleHTTPServer</code>.

  Djent, I mentioned in my blog post that there is an SSH gateway in
  between that blocks port forwarding, so your solution is not going
  to work.
</p>
<p>
  For example, say, I run the following command:
</p>
<pre><code>ssh -L 9000:127.0.0.1:8000 HOST</code></pre>
<p>
  Now when I visit <code>http://127.0.0.1:9000/</code> on my local
  system, I get a "connection reset by peer" error. At the same time,
  on the terminal where I have set up the port forward with the ssh
  command above, I get this error:
</p>
<pre><code>open failed: unknown channel type</code></pre>
<p>
  The SSH gateway forbids port forwarding as well.

  Honestly, I find it distasteful to have to spend time working around
  somebody's incompetence at securing systems.
</p>
<p>
  Doing it on your time means you delay delivering on your project and
  you let whoever did this get away with wasting everybody elses time.

  Susam, Your patience in (re-)explaining this constraint to everyone
  in this thread who thinks you don't know your way around standard
  Unix tools is impressive. :-)

  Lmilcin,

<p>
  While it may be distasteful, what's the alternative? Refusing on
  principle to use a system configured in a way you don't like is way
  more likely to hurt you than it is to hurt anyone else, especially
  the person who configured the system.
</p>
<p>
  Even if you are doing work for someone else (which, I think, is not
  indicated in the post), so that that person will be affected by your
  principled refusal, there's no guarantee that they're the ones who
  misconfigured the environment in which you're operating.

  Really nice article. I never thought such things can be done. A use
  case that I can think of is logging SSH sessions and see what I've
  done with them.
