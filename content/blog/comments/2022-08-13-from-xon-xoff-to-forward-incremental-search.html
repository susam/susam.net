  As an alternative, use <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>f</kbd> for
  "forward-inc-search"; it's easier to remember (mnemonic) and means
  you can still use <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd>
  or <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>q</kbd> for flow control as normal. For
  example, in Bash:
</p>
<pre><code>bind '"\C-f": forward-search-history'</code></pre>

  With respect to the cantrip, the below line
  in <code>~/.inputrc</code> might be preferable, as it remaps
  (forward) i-search to <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>^</kbd> for all programs
  using GNU-readline.
</p>
<pre><code>"\C-^": forward-search-history</code></pre>
<p>
  And if you edit <code>~/.inputrc</code>, consider adding a mapping
  for <code>kill-region</code>, in my case using an en-US keymap, its
  <kbd>esc</kbd> <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>@</kbd>, and permits to
  move/copy/erase character regions together
  with <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>y</kbd>
  and <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd> <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd>.
</p>
<pre><code>"\e\C-@": kill-region</code></pre>

  Thank you, Peter, for your comments. It took a few changes to get
  your Bash script to work properly in my shell. Since I do not
  have <code>PROMPT_COMMAND</code> set in my shell, the evaluation of
  the following prompt command
</p>
<pre><code>PROMPT_COMMAND="$PROMPT_COMMAND; : _IXONOFF"</code></pre>
<p>
  was causing this error:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>bash: PROMPT_COMMAND: line 0: syntax error near unexpected token `;'
bash: PROMPT_COMMAND: line 0: `; : _IXONOFF'</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  Here is how I modified your script to check
  if <code>PROMPT_COMMAND</code> is set before expanding it. If it is
  not set we use the null command <code>:</code> before the semicolon
  separator.
</p>
<pre>
<code>unset _IXON
PROMPT_COMMAND="${PROMPT_COMMAND:-:}; : _IXONOFF"
function _TRAP_DEBUG {
   if [ "$BASH_COMMAND" = ": _IXONOFF" ]; then
      stty -ixon
      _IXON=1
   elif [ "$_IXON" = "1" ]; then
      stty ixon
      unset _IXON
   fi
}
trap _TRAP_DEBUG DEBUG</code>
</pre>
<p>
  To test this, we can add the above script to <code>~/.bashrc</code>,
  then run something like <code>ping localhost</code> and confirm
  that <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd> pauses the output, whereas in the
  shell <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd> performs forward incremental
  search.

  This was a very interesting read! I have personally solved this by
  using fuzzy finder, which gives a menu/search box with a selection
  instead of the simplistic string matching
  of <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>r</kbd>.
</p>
<p>
  If you are a heavy terminal user, I would recommend looking into
  <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/fzf">https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/fzf</a>.
  I see the built-in search being especially useful on remote/shared
  machines, where you do not necessarily want to install stuff.
</p>
<p>
  The XON/XOFF feature actually seems quite useful for terminals
  without scrollback. Or for when you don't have a mouse. Hopefully
  I'll remember it. Thank you very much for your article!

  This is a great explanation, especially the part describing how
  control codes are mapped to their corresponding letters. I always
  felt there was probably some logic to it, but the idea never fully
  materialized into something I thought to investigate. Learning about
  how to disable XON/OFF is more like a bonus.
