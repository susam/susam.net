  &minus;40&nbsp;&deg;C = &minus;40&nbsp;&deg;F.
</p>
<p>
  A related joke:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Saul: It's &minus;40 outside.
  </p>
  <p>
    Paul: Fahrenheit or Celsius?
  </p>
  <p>
    Saul: When it's that cold, it's impossible to tell the difference.
  </p>

  16&nbsp;&deg;C = 61&nbsp&deg;F.  Much more useful summer conversion
  temperature in Ireland.

  It doesn't help much for people visiting here in the US, but when I
  travel outside the country I use this handy rhyme: 30 is hot.  20 is
  nice.  10 is cold.  0 is ice.

  The way I convert is to remember that 32&nbsp;&deg;F is
  0&nbsp;&deg;C and then count by "nines" for Fahrenheit to get the
  desired temperature in Celsius.
</p>
<p>
  32&nbsp;&deg;F =  0&nbsp;&deg;C<br>
  41&nbsp;&deg;F =  5&nbsp;&deg;C<br>
  50&nbsp;&deg;F = 10&nbsp;&deg;C<br>
  59&nbsp;&deg;F = 15&nbsp;&deg;C<br>
  68&nbsp;&deg;F = 20&nbsp;&deg;C<br>
  77&nbsp;&deg;F = 25&nbsp;&deg;C<br>
  86&nbsp;&deg;F = 30&nbsp;&deg;C<br>
  95&nbsp;&deg;F = 35&nbsp;&deg;C
</p>
<p>
  It's also pretty easy to remember that 10&nbsp;&deg;C =
  50&nbsp;&deg;F and 35&nbsp;&deg;C = 95&nbsp;&deg;F if you want to go
  forward or back from there with the same counting method.

  Thanks a lot for sharing this neat trick.  I just moved to North
  America and I just suffer as much.  Doubling and adding 30 is
  awesome.

  I came to your blog from another post by someone about
  <a href="https://mathb.in/">MathB.in</a>, love it.  Thanks for
  making it!

  An alternative approach to the accurate conversions, that may be
  easier to remember because it is more symmetric, is to first shift
  the temperatures so that the common value (-40) is the zero point,
  then scale, then shift back, that is,

  \begin{align*}
  f &amp; = (c + 40) \cdot \frac{9}{5} - 40, \\
  c &amp; = (f + 40) \cdot \frac{5}{9} - 40.
  \end{align*}

  The formula "looks" the same for each direction, just with inverted
  scaling factors.
