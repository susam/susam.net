  Interesting discussion. I gained something today by remembering you.

  I wouldn't call it a coincidence since to me the pseudocode problem
  is basically a reformulation of the original problem in terms of the
  recurrence relation.

<p>
  But the way to solve it is quite neat. Especially the combinatoric
  argument.

  Notya Bisnes, I <em>think</em> the story is that they both came up
  with reformulations of the same problem and asked them to each other
  over the same lunch. I for one find that quite amusing.

  Whirligig, Now that you mention it, that's pretty much the case. I
  don't know why I got hung on the "coincidence" thing. How dumb can I
  be, haha.
