  Susam, I'm glad we were able to get this resolved for you and I
  apologize for the inconvenience and the scare this caused you.

  Automated legal actions and takedowns like this introduce a lot of
  risk of collateral damage but I wonder what the alternatives are.
</p>
<p>
  The investigators would likely argue that notifying domain holders
  would reduce the chance that they can take down a botnet's
  infrastructure successfully, which seems likely.
</p>
<p>
  Could there be some maximum time after which the 'rule set' for the
  auto-takedown code needs to be made open source/public?  It must
  presumably be implemented as software and/or configuration files.
</p>
<p>
  That would at least allow for inspection, confirmation and disputes
  about how it's implemented, and if this was 30 days or so, it
  shouldn't risk the takedown effort.
</p>
<p>
  While top-tier network engineers are developing takedowns like this,
  presumably they'll do a good job of minimizing false positives - but
  as this case shows, it's not always going to be perfect - and I
  worry that if it becomes more common, we'll see sloppier
  implementations.
</p>
<p>
  That could lead to connectivity and access issues for more users
  (again in an international context).  It's great that the situation
  was resolved in this case but I imagine not all users would be able
  to raise a complaint at a similar level of technical detail and
  respectful tone and for it to receive the same amount of attention.
</p>
<p>
  Maybe that's untrue.  Maybe injustices really do get amplified by
  social media and relying on companies to notice this 'works'.  It
  doesn't sit particularly well with me as a remediation process
  though, and I'm not sure it scales.

  This was a really good write up, thank you.  And congratulations on
  getting your domain back.

  Props to you by reacting suitably: worried, but calm and measured
  and not jumping on some Twitter outrage bandwagon.

  The scariest part is that it looks like this got resolved quickly
  only because your tweet got noticed and retweeted.  I wonder how
  long it would have taken otherwise.

  Someone less technical would likely have no idea what happened to
  their domain.  An individual relying on their web presence for
  income could be massively impacted by something like this.  There
  really does not seem to be a clear way for someone to a) know what
  the problem is, and b) get it resolved quickly.

  As a small business owner, this terrifies me.  Since the TTL for NS
  records is 48 hours, a domain takeover like this could easily
  bankrupt a lot of SaaS companies.
</p>
<p>
  What options are there to prevent this?  Would a registrar such as
  MarkMonitor provide at least some notice or protection?

  A couple of years ago we lost our domain
  (see <a href="https://medium.com/thisiscala/the-duct-tape-holding-the-internet-together-12118be60ff1"><em>The Duct Tape Holding the Internet Together</em></a>)
  due to a registrar (that we were not a customer of) erroneously
  issuing a suspension.  The amount of honor system involved in the
  whole process, particularly in ccTLDs without as much oversight, was
  really surprising.

  Thank you for this.  We are definitely seeing the declining use of
  centralized domain-resolution.  It has advantages only when it is
  not <em>itself</em> being gamed, and increasingly companies and
  governmental orgs have found ways to do just that.  At the very
  least every domain should have dual central + decentral resolutions,
  and browsers should give you options when the resolutions conflict.

  I'm glad that this particular instance was resolved reasonably
  gracefully, but all it would have taken is a less informed or
  connected victim and it would have been so much worse.
