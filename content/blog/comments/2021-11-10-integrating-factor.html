  In practice, if I get a differential equation that I don't recognize
  and I want a closed-form solution, I check out
  <a href="http://eqworld.ipmnet.ru/">eqworld.ipmnet.ru</a> or one of
  the books produced by the same folks. It is like looking up
  integrals in an integral table. You look up the form of the equation
  you want, then they summarize the solution and cite the proof.
