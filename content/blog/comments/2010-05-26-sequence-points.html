  I completely agree with what you are trying to say.  I tried to
  explain the same stuff 6 years back when I was put incharge of
  designing questions for a programming competition.  I tried to
  explain it to organizers how ambiguous these questions can be,
  considering the fact that most participants/compilers do not follow
  the ANSI standard properly.  Secondly, these questions are not real
  test of programming skills, they are just some gimmicks to 'wow'
  people, real life programming is much different.

  The answers to such questions are not ambiguous.  They have an
  unambiguous answer: undefined behaviour.  In fact, I believe that these
  questions are a good test of how well one knows the C language.  If one
  writes code that invokes undefined behaviour or tries to predict the
  output of such code, it indicates missing knowledge.
</p>
<p>
  Further the knowledge of undefined behaviour is important for a
  professional software developer writing code in C.  Writing code in
  C without understanding the concept of undefined behaviour leads to
  fragile and insecure software.

  There are other features also in other programming languages like
  threading in Java which is completely dependent on JVM behavior
  or <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2011/04/garbage-collection-in-java.html">garbage
  collection in Java</a> which varies across JVM to JVM.

  Well, the reason why the same or similar questions arise is simple.
  People, out of ignorance, read wrong books and there are very few
  who can guide them to use the right books and the right
  platform/environment to learn C.  The Indian market is full of books
  that <em>still</em> teach C using Turbo C and the
  questions/exercises contain precisely questions about these.  Many
  of the examples in such books include <code>conio.h</code>!
