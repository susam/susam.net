  At work today, while calculating optimal parameters for a data
  structure, I arrived at this equation:

  \[
    x e^{-x} + (1 - e^{-x}) \ln (1 - e^{-x}) = 0.
  \]

  This equation is a little clumsy to deal with.  Let us make this neat
  by substituting \( e^{-x} \) with \( t.  \) Now we get

  \[
    -t \ln t + (1 - t) \ln (1 - t) = 0.
  \]

  If we rearrange this equation as

  \[
    t \ln t = (1 - t) \ln (1 - t),
  \]

  it is easy to see that one of the solutions is \( t = 1 - t, \) thus
  \( t = \frac{1}{2}.  \) Are there more solutions to this equation?
  The answer turns out to be: <em>no</em>.

  In this problem, \( x \) is a real number and so is \( t.  \) In the
  domain of real numbers, \( \ln t \) is undefined for \( t \le 0.  \)
  As a result, \( \ln (1 - t) \) is undefined for \( t \ge 1.  \)
  Therefore we need to look for values of \( t \) in the open interval
  \( (0, 1) \) that could be solutions to the equation.
</p>
<p>
  The function \( \ln t \) is a strictly increasing function for \( t
  &gt; 0.  \) This is easy to show from the derivative of \( \ln t.
  \) The derivative of \( \ln t \) is \( \frac{1}{t} \) which is
  strictly positive for \( t &gt; 0.  \)
<p>
<p>
  Since \( \ln t \) is a strictly increasing function for \( t &gt; 0,
  \) we can make the following conclusions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    For \( 0 &lt; t &lt; \frac{1}{2}, \) \( t &lt; (1 - t) \implies
    t \ln t &lt; (1 - t) \ln (1 - t).  \)
  </li>
  <li>
    For \( \frac{1}{2} &lt; t &lt; 1, \) \( t &gt; (1 - t) \implies
    t \ln t &gt; (1 - t) \ln (1 - t).  \)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  This proves that there are no values of \( t \) in the open
  intervals \( \left( 0, \frac{1}{2} \right) \) and \( \left(
  \frac{1}{2}, 1 \right) \) that could be solutions to the equation.
  Therefore \( t = \frac{1}{2} \) is the only solution to the
  equation.
</p>
<p>
  Since \( t = e^{-x}, \) we now arrive at the solution to the
  original equation expressed in terms of \( x \) as follows:

  \begin{align*}
    t = \frac{1}{2} &amp; \iff e^{-x} = \frac{1}{2} \\
                    &amp; \iff -x = \ln \frac{1}{2} \\
                    &amp; \iff x = \ln 2 \approx 0.6931.
  \end{align*}

  Here is another equation that I had to solve a couple of years ago:

  \[
    \ln x - x^{0.03} = 0.
  \]

  There is no simple way to solve this equation.  I had to resort to
  using the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert_W_function">Lambert W
  function</a> to solve this.  To use this function, we first need to
  bring our equation to the form \( f(x) e^{f(x)} = Y \) where \( f(x)
  \) is a function of \( x \) and \( Y \) is an expression that does
  not contain \( x.  \) The solution of \( f(x) e^{f(x)} = Y \) is \(
  f(x) = W(Y).  \) To summarize:

  \[
    f(x) e^{f(x)} = Y \iff f(x) = W(Y).
  \]

  Applying this technique to our equation, we get

  \begin{align*}
    \ln x - x^{0.03} = 0
    &amp; \iff \ln x = x^{0.03} \\
    &amp; \iff \ln x = e^{0.03 \ln x} \\
    &amp; \iff (\ln x)(e^{-0.03 \ln x}) = 1 \\
    &amp; \iff (-0.03 \ln x)(e^{-0.03 \ln x}) = -0.03.  \\
  \end{align*}

  We have brought the equation to the desired \( f(x) e^{f(x)} = Y \)
  form where \( f(x) = -0.03 \ln x \) and \( Y = -0.03.  \) Therefore
  the solution to this equation is

  \[
    -0.03 \ln x = W(-0.03).
  \]

  Simplifying this further, we get

  \[
    x = e^{\frac{W(-0.03)}{-0.03}}.
  \]

  The Maclaurin series of \( W(x) \) is given by

  \[
    W(x)
    = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-n)^{n-1}}{n!} x^n
    = x - x^2 + \frac{3}{2} x^3 - \frac{8}{3} x^4 +
      \frac{125}{24} x^5 - \dots
  \]

  Using the Maclaurin series of \( W(x), \) we get

  \[
    W(-0.03) \approx -0.0309428.
  \]

  Therefore

  \[
    x = e^{\frac{W(-0.03)}{-0.03}}
      \approx e^{\frac{-0.0309428}{-0.03}}
      \approx 2.80506.
  \]
