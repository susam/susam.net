Here is a puzzle I created recently for my friends who love to indulge
in recreational mathematics:
</p>

<div class="highlight">
Find all integer solutions to the equation
\[
  y^2 + 3 = \frac{x^3}{18}.
\]
</div>

think about it. There are spoilers ahead.

It does not take long to realize that this is a Diophantine equation of
the form \( a^n + b^n = c^n. \) Here is how the equation looks after
rearranging the terms:

\[
  x^3 = 18y^2 + 54.
\]
</p>

<p>
The right hand side is positive, so any \( x \) that satisfies this
equation must also be positive, i.e., \( x > 0 \) must hold good for any
solution \( x \) and \( y. \)
</p>

<p>
Also, if some \( y \) satisfies the equation, then \( -y \) also
satisfies the equation because the right hand side value remains the
same for both \( y \) and \( -y. \)
</p>

<p>
The right hand side is \( 2(9y^2 + 3^3). \) This is of the form \(
2(3a^2b + b^3) \) where \( a = y \) and \( b = 3. \) Now \( 2(3a^2b +
b^3) = (a + b)^3 - (a - b)^3. \) Using these details, we get

\begin{align*}
  x^3 = 18y^2 + 54
  & \iff x^3 = 2(9y^2 + 3^3) \\
  & \iff x^3 = (y + 3)^3 - (y - 3)^3 \\
  & \iff x^3 + (y - 3)^3 = (y + 3)^3.
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>
From Fermat's Last Theorem, we know that an equation of the form \( a^n
+ b^n = c^n \) does not have any solution for positive integers \( a, \)
\( b, \) \( c, \) and positive integer \( n > 2. \) Therefore we arrive
at the following constraints for any \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy
the equation:

\begin{align*}
       & x > 0, \\
-3 \le & y \le 3.
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>
We established the first constraint earlier when we discussed that \( x
\) must be positive. The second constraint follows from Fermat's Last
Theorem. If there were a solution \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( x > 0
\) and \( y > 3, \) then \( x^3 + (y - 3)^3 = (y + 3)^3 \) would
contradict Fermat's Last Theorem. Therefore \( y \le 3 \) must hold
good. Further since for every solution \( x \) and \( y, \) there is
also a solution \( x \) and \( -y, \) \( -y \le 3 \) must also hold
good.
</p>

<p>
Since \( y \) must be one of the seven integers between \( -3 \) and \(
3, \) inclusive, we can try solving for \( x \) with each of these seven
values of \( y. \) When we do so, we find that there are only two values
of \( y \) for which we get integer solutions for \( x. \) They are \( y
= 3 \) and \( y = -3. \) In both cases, we get \( x = 6. \) Therefore,
the solutions to the given equation are:

\begin{align*}
x & = 6 \\
y & = \pm 3.
\end{align*}
