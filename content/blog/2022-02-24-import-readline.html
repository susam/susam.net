<h2 id="toy-repl">Toy REPL</h2>
<p>
  Let us first write a tiny Python program to create a toy
  read-eval-print-loop (REPL) that does only one thing: add all
  integers entered as input into the REPL prompt. Here is the program:
</p>
<pre>
<code>while True:
    try:
        line = input('&gt; ')
        print(sum([int(n) for n in line.split()]))
    except ValueError as e:
        print('error:', e)
    except (KeyboardInterrupt, EOFError):
        break</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Here is how it works:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>python3 repl.py</kbd>
&gt; <kbd>10 20 30</kbd>
60
&gt; <kbd>40 50 60</kbd>
150
&gt; </samp>
</pre>
<p>
  If we now type <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> (the up arrow key)
  or <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd> to bring back the previous input, we
  see something like the following instead:
</p>
<pre><samp>> <kbd>^[[A^[[A^P^P</kbd></samp></pre>
<p>
  It shows the keys typed literally rather than bringing up previous
  input like most other interactive programs with a command-line
  interface do. The other programs that do bring up the previous input
  are able to do so because they provide line editing and history
  capability, often with the help of a line editing and history
  library like GNU Readline (libreadline) or BSD Editline (libedit).
</p>
<p>
  Can we have a similar line editing and history capability for our
  toy REPL? After all, the Python REPL itself offers such a line
  editing facility. Surely there must be a way to have this facility
  for our own programs too. Indeed there is!
</p>
<h2 id="line editing-and-history">Line Editing and History</h2>
<p>
  To enable line editing and history in our toy REPL, we just need to
  add <code>import readline</code> to our program. Here is how our
  program would look:
</p>
<pre>
<code>import readline

while True:
    try:
        line = input('> ')
        print(sum([int(n) for n in line.split()]))
    except ValueError as e:
        print('error:', e)
    except (KeyboardInterrupt, EOFError):
        break</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Now <kbd>&uarr;</kbd>, <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd>, etc. work as
  expected.
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>python3 repl.py</kbd>
> <kbd>10 20 30</kbd>
60
> <kbd>40 50 60</kbd>
150
> <kbd>40 50 60</kbd></samp>
</pre>
<p>
  The last line of input in the example above is obtained by typing
  either <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> or <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd>. In fact,
  all of the line editing keys like <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd> to go
  to the beginning of the line, <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>k</kbd> to kill
  the line after the cursor, etc. work as expected. The exact list of
  default key-bindings supported depends on the underlying
  line editing library being used by the <code>readline</code> module.
  The underlying library may be either the GNU Readline library or the
  BSD Editline library. There are some minor differences regarding the
  list of default key-bindings between these two libraries.
</p>
<h2 id="history-file">History File</h2>
<p>
  What we have done so far achieves the goal of bringing up previous
  inputs from the history. However, it does not bring back inputs from
  a previous invocation of the REPL. For example, if we start our toy
  REPL, enter some inputs, then quit it (say, by
  typing <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd>), start our toy REPL again, and
  type <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> or <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd>, it does not
  bring back the input from the previous invocation. For a full-blown
  REPL meant for sophisicated usage, we may want to preserve the
  history between different invocations of the REPL. This can be
  achieved by using the <code>read_history_file()</code>
  and <code>write_history_file()</code> functions as shown below:
</p>
<pre>
<code>import readline
import os

HISTORY_FILE = os.path.expanduser('~/.repl_history')
if os.path.exists(HISTORY_FILE):
    readline.read_history_file(HISTORY_FILE)

while True:
    try:
        line = input('> ')
        readline.write_history_file(HISTORY_FILE)
        print(sum([int(n) for n in line.split()]))
    except ValueError as e:
        print('error:', e)
    except (KeyboardInterrupt, EOFError):
        break</code>
</pre>
<p>

  Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/readline.html">readline
    documentation</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="rlwrap">Readline Wrapper</h2>
<p>
  At this point, it is worth mentioning that there are many
  interactive CLI tools that do not have line editing and history
  capabilities. They behave like our first toy REPL example in this
  post. Fortunately, there is the wonderful readline wrapper utility
  known as <code>rlwrap</code> that can be used to enable line editing
  and history in such tools. This utility can often be
  easily installed from package repositories of various operating
  systems. Here is a demonstration of this tool:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>rlwrap cat</kbd>
<kbd>hello</kbd>
hello
<kbd>world</kbd>
world
<kbd>world</kbd></samp>
</pre>
<p>
  The last line of input in the example above is obtained by typing
  either <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> or <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd>. In the
  above example, the input history is automatically saved
  to <code>~/.cat_history</code>, so it is possible to bring back
  inputs from a previous invocation of the command.

  Finally, an obligatory XKCD comic to conclude this post:

<p>
  While the days of achieving air flight with a
  single <code>import</code> statement might still be a few decades
  away, we do have the luxury to enable line editing and history in
  our REPLs with a single such statement right now.
