  Let us first first write a tiny Python program to create a toy
  read-eval-print-loop (REPL) that does only one thing: add all
  integers entered as input into the REPL prompt. Here is the program:
</p>
<pre>
<code>while True:
    try:
        line = input('&gt; ')
        print(sum([int(n) for n in line.split()]))
    except ValueError as e:
        print('error:', e)
    except (KeyboardInterrupt, EOFError):
        break</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Here is how it works:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>python3 repl.py</kbd>
&gt; <kbd>10 20 30</kbd>
60
&gt; <kbd>40 50 60</kbd>
150
&gt; </samp>
</pre>
<p>
  However, if we type <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> (the up arrow key)
  or <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd> to bring back the previous input, we
  see something like the following instead:
</p>
<pre><samp>> <kbd>^[[A^[[A^P^P</kbd></samp></pre>
<p>
  It shows the keys typed literally rather than bringing up previous
  input like most other interactive programs with a command-line
  interface do. The other programs that do bring up the previous input
  are able to do so because they provide line-editing capabilities,
  often with the help of a line-editing and history library like GNU
  Readline (libreadline) or BSD Editline (libedit).
</p>
<p>
  Can we have a similar line-editing capability for our toy REPL?
  After all, the Python REPL itself offers such a line-editing
  facility. Surely there must be a way to have this facility for our
  own programs too. Indeed there is! We just need to add <code>import
  readline</code> to our program. Here is how our program would look:
</p>
<pre>
<code>import readline

while True:
    try:
        line = input('> ')
        print(sum([int(n) for n in line.split()]))
    except ValueError as e:
        print('error:', e)
    except (KeyboardInterrupt, EOFError):
        break</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Now <kbd>&uarr;</kbd>, <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd>, etc. work as
  expected.
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>python3 repl.py</kbd>
> <kbd>10 20 30</kbd>
60
> <kbd>40 50 60</kbd>
150
> <kbd>40 50 60</kbd></samp>
</pre>
<p>
  The last line in the example above is obtained by
  typing <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> or <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd>. In fact,
  all of the line-editing keys like <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd> to go
  to the beginning of the line, <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>k</kbd> to kill
  the line after the cursor, etc. work as expected. The exact list of
  default key-bindings supported depends on the underlying
  line-editing library being used by the <code>readline</code> module.
  The underlying library may be either the GNU Readline library or the
  BSD Editline library. There are some minor differences regarding the
  list of default key-bindings between these two libraries.
</p>
<p>
  What we have done so far achieves the goal of bringing up previous
  inputs from the history. However, it does not bring back inputs from
  a previous invocation of the REPL. For example, if we start our toy
  REPL, enter some inputs, then quit it (say, by
  typing <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd>), start our toy REPL again, and
  type <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> or <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd>, it does not
  bring back the input from the previous invocation. For a full-blown
  REPL meant meant for sophisicated usage, we may want to preserve the
  history between different invocations of the REPL. This can be
  achieved by using the <code>read_history_file()</code>
  and <code>write_history_file()</code> functions as shown below:
</p>
<pre>
<code>import readline
import os

HISTORY_FILE = os.path.expanduser('~/.repl_history')
if os.path.exists(HISTORY_FILE):
    readline.read_history_file(HISTORY_FILE)

while True:
    try:
        line = input('> ')
        readline.write_history_file(HISTORY_FILE)
        print(sum([int(n) for n in line.split()]))
    except ValueError as e:
        print('error:', e)
    except (KeyboardInterrupt, EOFError):
        break</code>
</pre>

<p>
  While the days of achieving air flight with a
  single <code>import</code> statement might still be a few decades
  away, we do have the luxury to enable line-editing capabilities in
  our REPLs with a single such statement right now.
