<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>
  MS-DOS as well as Windows 98 come with a debugger program
  named <code>DEBUG.EXE</code> that can be used to work with assembly
  language instructions and machine code.  In MS-DOS version 6.22, this
  program is named <code>DEBUG.EXE</code> and it is typically present
  at <code>C:\DOS\DEBUG.EXE</code>.  On Windows 98, this program is
  usually present at <code>C:\Windows\Command\Debug.exe</code>.  It is
  a line-oriented debugger that supports various useful features to
  work with and debug binary executable programs consisting of machine
  code.
</p>
<p>
  In this post, we see how we can use this debugger program to
  assemble a few minimal programs that print some characters to
  standard output.  We first create a 7-byte program that prints a
  single character.  Then we create a 23-byte program that prints the
  "hello, world" string.  All the steps provided in this post work well
  with Windows 98 too.

<p>
  Let us first see how to create a tiny 7-byte program that prints the
  character <code>A</code> to standard output.  The
  following <code>DEBUG.EXE</code> session shows how we do it.
</p>
<pre>
<samp>C:\&gt;<kbd>DEBUG</kbd>
-<kbd>A</kbd>
1165:0100 <kbd>MOV AH, 2</kbd>
1165:0102 <kbd>MOV DL, 41</kbd>
1165:0104 <kbd>INT 21</kbd>
1165:0106 <kbd>RET</kbd>
1165:0107
-<kbd>G</kbd>
A
Program terminated normally
-<kbd>N A.COM</kbd>
-<kbd>R CX</kbd>
CX 0000
:<kbd>7</kbd>
-<kbd>W</kbd>
Writing 00007 bytes
-<kbd>Q</kbd>

C:\&gt;</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  Now we can execute this program as follows:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>C:\&gt;<kbd>A</kbd>
A
C:\&gt;</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  The debugger command <code>A</code> creates machine executable code
  from assembly language instructions.  The machine code created is
  written to the main memory at address CS:0100 by default.  The first
  three instructions generate the software interrupt 0x21 (decimal 33)
  with AH set to 2 and DL set to 0x41 (decimal 65) which happens to be
  the ASCII code of the character <code>A</code>.  Interrupt 0x21
  offers a wide variety of DOS services.  Setting AH to 2 tells this
  interrupt to invoke the function that prints a single character to
  standard output.  This function expects DL to be set to the ASCII
  code of the character we want to print.
</p>
<p>
  The command <code>G</code> executes the program in memory from the
  current location.  The current location is defined by the current
  value of CS:IP which is CS:0100 by default.  We use this command to
  confirm that the program runs as expected.
</p>
<p>
  Next we prepare to write the machine code to a binary executable
  file.  The command <code>N</code> is used to specify the name of the
  file.  The command <code>W</code> is used to write the machine code
  to the file.  This command expects the registers BX and CX to contain
  the number of bytes to be written to the file.  When the DOS debugger
  starts, BX is already initialised to 0, so we only set the register
  CX to 7 with the <code>R CX</code> command.  Finally, we use the
  command <code>Q</code> to quit the debugger and return to MS-DOS.
</p>
<h2 id="hello-world">Hello, World</h2>
<p>
  The following <code>DEBUG.EXE</code> session shows how to create a
  program that prints a string.
</p>
<pre>
<samp>C:\&gt;<kbd>DEBUG</kbd>
-<kbd>A</kbd>
1165:0100 <kbd>MOV AH, 9</kbd>
1165:0102 <kbd>MOV DX, 108</kbd>
1165:0105 <kbd>INT 21</kbd>
1165:0107 <kbd>RET</kbd>
1165:0108 <kbd>DB 'hello, world', D, A, '$'</kbd>
1165:0117
-<kbd>G</kbd>
hello, world

Program terminated normally
-<kbd>N HELLO.COM</kbd>
-<kbd>R CX</kbd>
CX 0000
:<kbd>17</kbd>
-<kbd>W</kbd>
Writing 00017 bytes
-<kbd>Q</kbd>

C:\&gt;</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  Now we can execute this 23-byte program like this:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>C:\&gt;<kbd>HELLO</kbd>
hello, world

C:\&gt;</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  In the program above we use the pseudo-instruction <code>DB</code>
  to define the bytes of the string we want to print.  We add the
  trailing bytes 0xD and 0xA to print the carriage return (CR) and the
  line feed (LF) characters so that the string is terminated with a
  newline.  Finally, the string is terminated with the byte for dollar
  sign (<code>'$'</code>) because the software interrupt we generate
  next expects the string to be terminated with this symbol's byte
  value.
</p>
<p>
  We use the software interrupt 0x21 again.  However, this time we set
  AH to 9 to invoke the function that prints a string.  This function
  expects DS:DX to point to the address of a string terminated with
  the byte value of <code>'$'</code>.  The register <code>DS</code> has
  the same value as that of <code>CS</code>, so we only
  set <code>DX</code> to the offset at which the string begins.
</p>
<h2 id="debugger-scripting">Debugger Scripting</h2>
<p>
  We have already seen above how to assemble a "hello, world" program
  in the previous section.  We started the debugger program, typed some
  commands, and typed assembly language instructions to create our
  program.  It is also possible to prepare a separate input file with
  all the debugger commands and assembly language instructions in it.
  We then feed this file to the debugger program.  This can be useful
  while writing more complex programs where we cannot afford to lose
  our assembly language source code if we inadvertently crash the
  debugger by executing an illegal instruction.
</p>
<p>
  To create a separate input file that can be fed to the debugger, we
  may use the DOS command <code>EDIT HELLO.TXT</code> to open a new
  file with MS-DOS Editor, then type in the following debugger
  commands, and then save and exit the editor.
</p>
<pre>
<code>A
MOV AH, 9
MOV DX, 108
INT 21
RET
DB 'hello, world', D, A, '$'

N HELLO.COM
R CX
17
W
Q</code>
</pre>
<p>
  This is almost the same as the inputs we typed into the debugger in
  the previous section.  The only difference from the previous section
  is that we omit the <code>G</code> command here because we don't
  really need to run the program while assembling it, although we
  could do so if we really wanted to.
</p>
<p>
  Then we can run the DOS command <code>DEBUG &lt; HELLO.TXT</code> to
  assemble the program and create the binary executable file.  Here is
  a DOS session example that shows what the output of this command
  looks like:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>C:\&gt;<kbd>DEBUG &lt; HELLO.TXT</kbd>
-A
1165:0100 MOV AH, 9
1165:0102 MOV DX, 108
1165:0105 INT 21
1165:0107 RET
1165:0108 DB 'hello, world', D, A, '$'
1165:0117
-N HELLO.COM
-R CX
CX 0000
:17
-W
Writing 00017 bytes
-Q

C:\&gt;</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  The output is in fact very similar to the debugger session in the
  previous section.
</p>
<h2 id="disassembly">Disassembly</h2>
<p>
  Now that we have seen how to assemble simple programs into binary
  executable files using the debugger, we will now briefly see how to
  disassemble the binary executable files.  This could be useful when
  we want to debug an existing program.
</p>
<pre>
<samp>C:\&gt;<kbd>DEBUG A.COM</kbd>
-<kbd>U 100 106</kbd>
117C:0100 B402          MOV     AH,02
117C:0102 B241          MOV     DL,41
117C:0104 CD21          INT     21
117C:0106 C3            RET</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  The debugger command <code>U</code> (unassemble) is used to
  translate the binary machine code to assembly language mnemonics.
</p>
<pre>
<samp>C:\&gt;<kbd>DEBUG HELLO.COM</kbd>
-<kbd>U 100 116</kbd>
117C:0100 B409          MOV     AH,09
117C:0102 BA0801        MOV     DX,0108
117C:0105 CD21          INT     21

<h2 id="int-20-vs-ret">INT 20 vs RET</h2>
<p>
  Another way to terminate a .COM program is to simply use the
  instruction <code>INT 20</code>.  This consumes two bytes in the
  machine code: <code>CD 20</code>.  While producing the smallest
  possible executables was not really the goal of this post, the code
  examples above indulge in a little bit of size reduction by using
  the <code>RET</code> instruction to terminate the program.  This
  consumes only one byte: <code>C3</code>.  This works because when a
  .COM file starts, the register SP contains FFFE.  The stack memory
  locations at offset FFFE and FFFF contain 00 and 00, respectively.
  Further, the memory address offset 0000 contains the
  instruction <code>INT 20</code>.  Here is a demonstration of these
  facts using the debugger program:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>C:\&gt;<kbd>DEBUG HELLO.COM</kbd>
-<kbd>R SP</kbd>
SP FFFE
:
-<kbd>D FFFE</kbd>
117C:FFF0                                            00 00
-<kbd>U 0 1</kbd>
117C:0000 CD20          INT     20</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  As a result, executing the <code>RET</code> instruction pops 0000
  off the stack at FFFE and loads it into IP.  This results in the
  instruction <code>INT 20</code> at offset 0000 getting executed
  which leads to program termination.
</p>
<p>
  While both <code>INT 20</code> and <code>RET</code> lead to
  successful program termination both in DOS as well as while
  debugging with <code>DEBUG.EXE</code>, there is some difference
  between them which affects the debugging experience.  Terminating the
  program with <code>INT 20</code> allows us to run the program
  repeatedly within the debugger by repeated applications of
  the <code>G</code> debugger command.  But when we terminate the
  program with <code>RET</code>, we cannot run the program repeatedly
  in this manner.  The program runs and terminates successfully the
  first time we run it in the debugger but the stack does not get
  reinitialised with zeros to prepare it for another execution of the
  program within the debugger.  Therefore when we try to run the
  program the second time using the <code>G</code> command, the
  program does not terminate successfully.  It hangs instead.  It is
  possible to work around this by reinitialising the stack with the
  debugger command <code>E FFFE 0 0</code> before
  running <code>G</code> again.
</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  Although the DOS debugger is very limited in features in comparison
  with sophisticated assemblers like NASM, MASM, etc., this humble
  program can perform some of the basic operations involved in working
  with assembly language and machine code.  It can read and write
  binary executable files, examine memory, execute machine
  instructions in memory, modify registers, edit binary files, etc.
  The fact that this debugger program is always available with MS-DOS
  or Windows 98 system means that these systems are ready for some
  rudimentary assembly language programming without requiring any
  additional tools.
