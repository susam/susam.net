<h2 id="date-formats">Date Formats</h2>

<p>
There are three popular date formats followed worldwide: big-endian,
little-endian, and middle-endian. Here is how today's date looks like in
these formats if the year is written out in full:
</p>

<table class="grid center">
  <tr>
    <th>Endianness</th>
    <th>Format</th>
    <th>Date</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Big-endian</td>
    <td>YYYY-MM-DD</td>
    <td>2020-02-02</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Little-endian</td>
    <td>DD-MM-YYYY</td>
    <td>02-02-2020</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Middle-endian</td>
    <td>MM-DD-YYYY</td>
    <td>02-02-2020</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
The ISO 8601 standard specifies the big-endian date format. The
big-endian format is popular in Canada, China, Japan, Lithuania, etc.
The little-endian format is used by the majority of the world including
countries like Brazil, Egypt, Germany, India, Italy, United Kingdom,
etc. The middle-endian date format is primarily used in the Philippines
and the United States.

<p>
The preferred choice of delimiter between the date components (day,
month, and year) varies from country to country. In this post, we use
hyphen (i.e., "-") as the delimiter.
</p>


<h2 id="palindromes">Palindromes</h2>

<p>
Today's date is a palindrome in all three date formats, i.e., it reads
the same backward as forward in all three formats. It is <em>globally
palindromic</em>. Note that we ignore the hyphens or any other
delimiters while deciding if a date is palindrome or not. In fact, in
general, punctuation, capitalization, and spaces are usually ignored
while deciding if a given text is palindrome or not.
</p>

<p>
Let me define <em>global palindrome day</em> to be a day when its date
is a palindrome in all three date formats (YYYY-MM-DD, DD-MM-YYYY, and
MM-DD-YYYY). Then today is a global palindrome day!
</p>

<p>
There are only eleven such global palindrome days between the years 1000
and 9999. Here is a list that enumerates all of them:
</p>

<p style="font-family: monospace,monospace" class="textcenter">
1010-01-01<br>
1111-11-11<br>
2020-02-02<br>
2121-12-12<br>
3030-03-03<br>
4040-04-04<br>
5050-05-05<br>
6060-06-06<br>
7070-07-07<br>
8080-08-08<br>
9090-09-09<br>
</p>

<p>
The previous global palindrome day was over 908 years ago! The next such
day is over 101 years away!
</p>

<p>
Today is special in another way. It is day 33 (a palindrome) of the
current year and 333 (also a palindrome) days remain in the year.
</p>


<h2 id="ambigrams">Ambigrams</h2>

<p>
As a bonus, today is also a <em>global strobogrammatic day</em> when
viewed on a seven-segment display, i.e., for all three date formats,
today's date when shown, without the delimiters, on a seven-segment
display appears the same when rotated by 180&deg;. A strobogrammatic
sequence of digits like this is also a type of ambigram. Here is how
today's date looks in YYYYMMDD, DDMMYYYY, and MMDDYYYY formats on a
seven-segment display:

<p>
In the list of global palindrome days provided in the previous
section, six of the eleven days are global strobogrammatic days too.
Only the ones that belong to the years 3030, 4040, 6060, 7070, and 9090
are not strobogrammatic on a seven-segment display; the rest all are.
