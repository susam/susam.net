  I have been running a mailing list called <em>ncoders</em> on Yahoo
  Groups for the past few months.  I created it to host discussions on
  computers, programming and network protocols among university
  students.  There are currently about 150 students from various
  universities across the world on the list.  A few weeks ago, someone
  posted a C programming puzzle to the group.  The puzzle asked
  whether it was possible to write a C program such that the
  <code>main()</code> function <em>does not seem to appear</em> in the
  code.  Here's a solution I came up with, which involves obfuscating
  the identifier <code>main</code> using preprocessor macros and
  the <code>##</code> token-pasting operator.
</p>
<pre>
<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

#define decode(s,t,u,m,p,e,d) m ## s ## u ## t
#define begin decode(a,n,i,m,a,t,e)

int begin()
{
    printf("Stumped?\n");
}</code>
</pre>
<p>
  This program compiles and runs successfully.  Here is the output:
</p>
<pre><samp>Stumped?</samp></pre>
<p>
  Let me explain how this code works.  When the C preprocessor runs on
  this code, the following preprocessing steps occur:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>begin</code> is replaced with <code>decode(a,n,i,m,a,t,e)</code>,
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>decode(a,n,i,m,a,t,e)</code> is replaced with <code>m ## a
    ## i ## n</code> and
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>m ## a ## i ## n</code> is replaced with <code>main</code>.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Thus <code>begin()</code> is replaced with <code>main()</code>.
</p>

  <strong>Update on 31 Jul 2007:</strong> Although the mailing list
  referred to in this post no longer exists, this tiny piece of code
  seems to have survived on the web.  A
  <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22decode%28s%2Ct%2Cu%2Cm%2Cp%2Ce%2Cd%29%22">quick
  search</a> shows so many occurrences of this code on the web.  It is
  quite surprising to me that a rather silly piece of code written
  during a Sunday afternoon to solve an equally silly puzzle has been
  the subject of much discussion!
