  In this article, we explore a few well-known results from abstract
  algebra pertaining to fields and integral domains.  We ask ourselves
  whether every field is an integral domain, and whether every
  integral domain is a field.  We begin with the definition of an
  integral domain, discuss a few established results, and then proceed
  to answer these questions.

<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>
<p>
  An integral domain is a non-trivial commutative ring in which the
  product of any two non-zero elements is also non-zero.
</p>
<h2 id="known-results">Known Results</h2>
<p>
  Familiarity with basic algebraic structures is assumed.  For the
  sake of brevity, we also assume the following known results:
</p>
<p id="zero-multiplication">
  <strong>Proposition 1.</strong>
  <em>
    Let \( R \) be a ring.  Then, for all \( a \in R \), we have

    \[
      a \cdot 0 = 0 \cdot a = 0.
    \]
  </em>
</p>
<p id="cancellation-property">
  <strong>Proposition 2.</strong>
  <em>
    Let \( D \) be an integral domain.  Then, for all \( a, b, c \in D \) such
    that \( a \ne 0 \), we have

    \[
      a \cdot b = a \cdot c \implies b = c.
    \]
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  The second result is also known as the <em>cancellation property of
  integral domains</em>.
</p>
<h2 id="every-field-is-an-integral-domain">Every Field Is an Integral Domain</h2>
<p>
  We now show that every field is indeed an integral domain.  Let \( F
  \) be a field, and let \( a, b \in F \) such that \( ab = 0 \).
  There are two cases to consider: \( a = 0 \) and \( a \ne 0 \).  If
  \( a = 0 \), then indeed \( ab = 0 \)
  by <a href="#zero-multiplication">Proposition 1</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Now suppose \( a \ne 0 \).  Then by the properties of fields, there exists a
  multiplicative inverse \( a^{-1} \in F \) such that \( a \cdot
  a^{-1} = 1 \).  Then using the properties of fields, we get

  \[
    b = b \cdot 1 = b \cdot (a \cdot a^{-1}) = (a \cdot b) \cdot
    a^{-1} = 0 \cdot a^{-1} = 0.
  \]

  The last equality follows from
  <a href="#zero-multiplication">Proposition 1</a>.  We have shown
  that if \( ab = 0 \), then either \( a = 0 \) or \( b = 0 \).
  Therefore, if both \( a \ne 0 \) and \( b \ne 0 \), then it must be
  that \( ab \ne 0 \).  Therefore \( F \) is an integral domain.
</p>
<h2 id="infinite-integral-domains">Infinite Integral Domains</h2>
<p>
  Now we arrive at the next natural question.  Is every integral
  domain a field?
</p>
<p>
  The set of integers \( \mathbb{Z} \) is an integral domain, since
  the product of any two non-zero integers is a non-zero.  However, \(
  \mathbb{Z} \) is not a field since \( 2 \in \mathbb{Z} \), but \(
  2^{-1} \not\in \mathbb{Z} \).  Therefore, not every integral domain
  is a field.  Here we saw an example of an infinite integral domain
  that is not a field.
</p>
<p>
  Next we ask ourselves: Is every infinite integral domain not a
  field?  Not quite!  Some infinite integral domains are, in fact,
  fields.  This follows directly from the result in the previous
  section.  Every field is an integral domain, and there are plenty of
  infinite fields, so they must all be integral domains too.  Consider
  the set of rational numbers \( \mathbb{Q} \) or the set of complex
  numbers \( \mathbb{C} \).  These infinite sets are fields and
  therefore also integral domains.  So, clearly, there are infinite
  integral domains that are also fields.
</p>
<h2 id="every-finite-integral-domain-is-a-field">Every Finite Integral Domain Is a Field</h2>
<p>
  We will now turn our attention to finite integral domains.  Is every
  finite integral domain a field?  Yes!  This can be shown as follows.
</p>
<p>
  Let \( D \) be a finite integral domain.  Let \( a \in D \) with \(
  a \ne 0 \).  Consider the set

  \[
    A = \{ a, a^2, a^3, \dots \}.
  \]

  Since a ring is closed under multiplication, every element of \( A
  \) belongs to \( D \), so \( A \subseteq D \).  Since \( D \) is
  finite, \( A \) is finite too.  Therefore, by the pigeonhole
  principle, there exist integers \( m \gt n \ge 0 \) such that

  \[
    a^m = a^n
  \]

  This equation can be rewritten as

  \[
    a \cdot a^{m - n - 1} \cdot a^n = 1 \cdot a^n.
  \]

  Since \( a \) is a non-zero element of an integral domain, it
  follows that \( a^n \ne 0 \). Therefore we can use
  <a href="#cancellation-property">Proposition 2</a> (the cancellation
  property of integral domains) to get

  \[
    a \cdot a^{m - n - 1} = 1.
  \]

  Since a ring is closed under multiplication and since \( m - n - 1
  \ge 0 \), it follows that \( a^{m - n - 1} \in D \).  Thus every
  non-zero element \( a \in D \) has a multiplicative inverse in \( D
  \).  This establishes the multiplicative inverse property of a
  field.
</p>
<p>
  Since an integral domain is a non-trivial commutative ring, it has
  at least two distinct elements: \( 0 \) and \( 1 \).  This
  establishes two additional field properties: the existence of an
  additive identity and the existence of a multiplicative identity
  distinct from the additive identity.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, the remaining field properties are inherited from the ring
  structure, i.e., associativity and commutativity of addition and
  multiplication, the existence of additive inverses, and the
  distributivity of multiplication over addition all hold in \( D \),
  since they hold in any ring.  Thus, \( D \) satisfies all the field
  properties.  Therefore \( D \) is a field.
</p>
<h3 id="alternate-proof">Alternate Proof</h2>
<p>
  The proof in the previous section presents what I initially came up
  with when working through these concepts and I wanted to prove these
  facts for myself.  However, I later found that there is another
  proof that is quite popular in the literature. This alternate proof
  differs in one key aspect: it does not invoke the cancellation
  property of integral domains stated in
  <a href="#cancellation-property">Proposition 2</a>.  Let us now see
  what this alternate proof looks like.
</p>
<p>
  As before, we consider the set \( A = \{ a, a^2, a^3, \dots \}
  \subseteq D \), where \( a \in D \) and \( a \ne 0 \), and we obtain
  the equation

  \[
    a^m = a^n
  \]

  for some integers \( m \gt n \ge 0 \).  As before, we use the fact
  that \( a \) is an element of an integral domain to conclude that \(
  a^n \ne 0 \).  Now adding the additive inverse of \( a^n \) to both
  sides and using the distributivity property of rings, we get

  \[
    a^n (a^{m - n} - 1) = 0
  \]

  Since a ring is closed under addition and multiplication, both \(
  a^n \) and \( a^{m - n} - 1 \) belong to \( D \).  As \( D \) is
  an integral domain and \( a^n \ne 0 \), we conclude that \( a^{m -
  n} - 1 = 0 \), i.e., \( a^{m - n} = 1 \).  Since \( m - n \gt 1 \),
  we can write:

  \[
    a \cdot a^{m - n - 1} = 1.
  \]

  Therefore every non-zero element \( a \in D \) has a multiplicative
  inverse in \( D \).  This establishes the multiplicative inverse
  property of a field.  The remaining properties of a field are
  established in the same manner as in the previous section.  Hence,
  if \( D \) is a finite integral domain, then it is also a field.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  We will summarise all the results here before concluding the
  article:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Every field is an integral domain.
  </li>
  <li>
    Every <em>finite</em> integral domain is a field.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some infinite integral domains are not fields.  A convenient
    example is the set of integers \( \mathbb{Z} \).
  </li>
  <li>
    Some infinite integral domains are fields.  Every infinite field,
    such as \( \mathbb{Q} \), \( \mathbb{R} \), or \( \mathbb{C} \),
    is an example.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  It is worth reiterating that the final result in the summary above
  follows from the fact that every field is an integral domain.  These
  results reveal how structure and size interact in algebraic systems.
  It is fascinating how simply being finite can turn an integral
  domain into a field.
