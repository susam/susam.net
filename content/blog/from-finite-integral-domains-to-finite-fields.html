  In this article, we explore a few well-known results from abstract
  algebra pertaining to fields and integral domains.  We ask ourselves
  whether every field is an integral domain, and whether every
  integral domain is a field.  We begin with the definition of an
  integral domain, discuss a few established results, and then proceed
  to answer these questions.  Familiarity with algebraic structures
  such as rings and fields is assumed.

<h2 id="definition-of-integral-domain">Definition of Integral Domain</h2>
<p>
  An <em>integral domain</em> is a commutative ring, with distinct
  additive and multiplicative identities, in which the product of any
  two non-zero elements is also non-zero.
</p>
<p>
  Equivalently, an integral domain is a commutative ring, with
  distinct additive and multiplicative identities, such that if the
  product of two elements is zero, then one of the elements must be
  zero.
</p>
<p>
  Using standard notation, we can write that a commutative ring \( R
  \) is an integral domain if \( 0 \ne 1 \) and for \( a, b \in R \),

  \[
    a \ne 0 \text{ and } b \ne 0 \implies a \cdot b \ne 0
  \]

  or equivalently,

  \[
    a \cdot b = 0 \implies a = 0 \text{ or } b = 0.
  \]

  There are many other alternative ways to define an integral domain
  which are all equivalent.  In a ring \( R \), a <em>zero
  divisor</em> is a non-zero element \( a \in R \) such that there
  exists a non-zero element \( b \in R \) with \( ab = 0 \).  With
  this definition of a zero divisor, we can define an integral domain
  to be a unital commutative ring, with \( 0 \ne 1 \), that has no
  zero divisors.
</p>
<h2 id="examples-of-integral-domain">Examples of Integral Domains</h2>
<p>
  The ring of integers \( \mathbb{Z} \) is an integral domain since
  the product of two non-zero integers is non-zero.  The field of
  rational numbers \( \mathbb{Q} \) is also an integral domain.  The
  ring of polynomials in the indeterminate \( t \) with coefficients
  in an integral domain \( R \), denoted \( R[t] \), is an integral
  domain as well.
</p>
<p>
  The ring of integers modulo 5, denoted \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \) is an
  integral domain.  However, the ring of integers modulo 6, denoted \(
  \mathbb{Z}_6 \), is not an integral domain since \( 2 \cdot 3 = 0 \)
  in \( \mathbb{Z}_6 \).  In other words, \( \mathbb{Z}_6 \) has zero
  divisors, namely \( 2 \) and \( 3 \), so it is not an integral
  domain.  In fact, the ring of integers modulo \( n \), denoted \(
  \mathbb{Z}_n \) is an integral domain if and only if \( n \) is
  prime.
</p>
<h2 id="known-results">Known Results</h2>
<p>
  For the sake of brevity, we assume the following known results.
</p>
<p id="zero-multiplication">
  <strong>Proposition 1.</strong>
  <em>
    Let \( R \) be a ring.  Then, for all \( a \in R \), we have

    \[
      a \cdot 0 = 0 \cdot a = 0.
    \]
  </em>
</p>
<p id="cancellation-property">
  <strong>Proposition 2.</strong>
  <em>
    Let \( D \) be an integral domain.  Then, for all \( a, b, c \in D \) such
    that \( a \ne 0 \), we have

    \[
      a \cdot b = a \cdot c \implies b = c.
    \]
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  The second result is also known as the <em>cancellation property of
  integral domains</em>.
</p>
<h2 id="on-distinct-identities">On Distinct Identities</h2>
<p>
  We have been mentioning the distinctiveness of the additive and
  multiplicative identities as a property of an integral domain.  Some
  texts express this more concisely by saying that an integral domain
  is a <em>non-zero</em> unital commutative ring without zero
  divisors, i.e., the zero ring \( \{ 0 \} \) is excluded from the
  definition.
</p>
<p>
  This follows directly from
  <a href="#zero-multiplication">Proposition 1</a>.  If \( 0 = 1 \in R
  \), then for all \( r \in R \), we get

  \[
    r = r \cdot 1 = r \cdot 0 = 0
  \]

  which means that every element of \( R \) is zero, i.e., \( R = \{ 0
  \} \).  To summarise

  \[ 0 = 1 \in R \implies R = \{ 0 \} \]

  or equivalently, for a ring \( R \) with unity,

  \[
    R \ne \{ 0 \} \implies 0 \ne 1.
  \]

  Further, if \( 0 \) and \( 1 \) are two distinct elements of \( R
  \), then \( R \) has at least two elements, so for a ring \( R \)
  with unity,

  \[
    0 \ne 1 \implies R \ne \{ 0 \}
  \]

  Therefore, a ring with unity has distinct additive and
  multiplicative identities if and only if it is a non-zero ring.  This
  is why an integral domain can also be defined as a non-zero unital
  commutative ring without zero divisors.
</p>
<h2 id="every-field-is-an-integral-domain">Every Field Is an Integral Domain</h2>
<p>
  We now show that every field is indeed an integral domain.  Let \( F
  \) be a field, and let \( a, b \in F \) such that \( ab = 0 \).
  There are two cases to consider: \( a = 0 \) and \( a \ne 0 \).  If
  \( a = 0 \), we are done.
</p>
<p>
  Now suppose \( a \ne 0 \).  Then by the properties of fields, there exists a
  multiplicative inverse \( a^{-1} \in F \) such that \( a \cdot
  a^{-1} = 1 \).  Then using the properties of fields, we get

  \[
    b = b \cdot 1 = b \cdot (a \cdot a^{-1}) = (a \cdot b) \cdot
    a^{-1} = 0 \cdot a^{-1} = 0.
  \]

  The last equality follows from
  <a href="#zero-multiplication">Proposition 1</a>.  We have shown
  that if \( ab = 0 \), then either \( a = 0 \) or \( b = 0 \).
  Therefore, if both \( a \ne 0 \) and \( b \ne 0 \), then it must be
  that \( ab \ne 0 \).  Therefore \( F \) is an integral domain.
</p>
<h2 id="infinite-integral-domains">Infinite Integral Domains</h2>
<p>
  Now we arrive at the next natural question.  Is every integral
  domain a field?
</p>
<p>
  The ring of integers \( \mathbb{Z} \) is an integral domain but it
  is not a field since \( 2 \in \mathbb{Z} \), but \( 2^{-1} \notin
  \mathbb{Z} \).  Therefore, \( \mathbb{Z} \) is an example of an
  infinite integral domain that is not a field.
</p>
<p>
  Next we ask ourselves: Is every infinite integral domain not a
  field?  Not quite!  Some infinite integral domains are, in fact,
  fields.  This follows directly from the result in the previous
  section.  Every field is an integral domain, and there are plenty of
  infinite fields, so they must all be integral domains too.  Consider
  the field of rational numbers \( \mathbb{Q} \) or the field of
  complex numbers \( \mathbb{C} \).  Since these are fields, they are
  also integral domains.  So, clearly, there are infinite integral
  domains that are also fields.
</p>
<h2 id="every-finite-integral-domain-is-a-field">Every Finite Integral Domain Is a Field</h2>
<p>
  We will now turn our attention to finite integral domains.  Is every
  finite integral domain a field?  Yes!  This can be shown as follows.
</p>
<p>
  Let \( D \) be a finite integral domain.  Let \( a \in D \) with \(
  a \ne 0 \).  Consider the set

  \[
    A = \{ a, a^2, a^3, \dots \}.
  \]

  Since a ring is closed under multiplication, every element of \( A
  \) belongs to \( D \), so \( A \subseteq D \).  Since \( D \) is
  finite, \( A \) is finite too.  Therefore, by the pigeonhole
  principle, there exist integers \( m \gt n \ge 0 \) such that

  \[
    a^m = a^n
  \]

  This equation can be rewritten as

  \[
    a \cdot a^{m - n - 1} \cdot a^n = 1 \cdot a^n.
  \]

  Since \( a \) is a non-zero element of an integral domain, it
  follows that \( a^n \ne 0 \).  Therefore we can use
  <a href="#cancellation-property">Proposition 2</a> (the cancellation
  property of integral domains) to get

  \[
    a \cdot a^{m - n - 1} = 1.
  \]

  Since a ring is closed under multiplication and since \( m - n - 1
  \ge 0 \), it follows that \( a^{m - n - 1} \in D \).  Thus every
  non-zero element \( a \in D \) has a multiplicative inverse in \( D
  \).  This establishes the multiplicative inverse property of a
  field.
</p>
<p>
  Since an integral domain has distinct additive and multiplicative
  identities, it satisfies two additional field properties: the
  existence of an additive identity and a distinct multiplicative
  identity.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, the remaining field properties are inherited from the ring
  structure, i.e., associativity and commutativity of addition and
  multiplication, the existence of additive inverses, and the
  distributivity of multiplication over addition all hold in \( D \),
  since they hold in any ring.  Thus, \( D \) satisfies all the field
  properties.  Therefore \( D \) is a field.
</p>
<h3 id="alternate-proof">Alternate Proof</h3>
<p>
  The proof in the previous section presents what I initially came up
  with while working through these concepts and proving these results
  for myself.  However, I later found that there is another proof that
  is quite popular in the literature.  This alternate proof differs in
  one key aspect: it does not invoke the cancellation property of
  integral domains stated in
  <a href="#cancellation-property">Proposition 2</a>.  Let us examine
  this alternate proof.
</p>
<p>
  As before, we consider the set \( A = \{ a, a^2, a^3, \dots \}
  \subseteq D \), where \( a \in D \) and \( a \ne 0 \), and we obtain
  the equation

  \[
    a^m = a^n
  \]

  for some integers \( m \gt n \ge 0 \).  As before, we use the fact
  that \( a \) is an element of an integral domain to conclude that \(
  a^n \ne 0 \).  Now adding the additive inverse of \( a^n \) to both
  sides we get

  \[
    a^m - a^n = 0.
  \]

  Using the distributivity property of rings, we get

  \[
    a^n (a^{m - n} - 1) = 0
  \]

  Since a ring is closed under addition and multiplication, both \(
  a^n \) and \( a^{m - n} - 1 \) belong to \( D \).  As \( D \) is an
  integral domain and \( a^n \ne 0 \), we conclude that \( a^{m - n} -
  1 = 0 \).  Therefore \( a^{m - n} = 1 \).  Since \( m - n \ge 1 \),
  we can write:

  \[
    a \cdot a^{m - n - 1} = 1.
  \]

  Therefore every non-zero element \( a \in D \) has a multiplicative
  inverse in \( D \).  The remaining properties of a field are
  established in the same manner as in the previous section.  Hence,
  if \( D \) is a finite integral domain, then it is also a field.
</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  We now summarise all the results here before concluding the article:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Every field is an integral domain.
  </li>
  <li>
    Every <em>finite</em> integral domain is a field.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some infinite integral domains are not fields.  A convenient
    example is the set of integers \( \mathbb{Z} \).
  </li>
  <li>
    Some infinite integral domains are fields.  Every infinite field,
    such as \( \mathbb{Q} \), \( \mathbb{R} \), or \( \mathbb{C} \) is
    an example.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  It is worth reiterating here that the fourth result in the summary
  above follows from the fact that every field is an integral domain.
  These results reveal how structure and size interact in algebraic
  systems.  It is interesting how simply being finite guarantees that
  an integral domain is a field.
