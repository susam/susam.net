<!-- title: IncredibleIndia.org Attacked Twice -->
<!-- tag: security technology -->
<p>
<a href="http://www.incredibleindia.org/">IncredibleIndia.org</a> has a
security loophole</a>.
</p>

<p>
The vulnerability was reported to the administrator of the website in
the first week of April 2006 but no action was taken. Then I released a
<a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/431444">security
advisory</a> describing the issue on 16 April 2006. The security hole is
an SQL injection vulnerability present in the following URL: <a
href="http://www.incredibleindia.org/newsite/cms_page.asp?pageid=1110">http://www.incredibleindia.org/newsite/cms_page.asp?pageid=1110</a>.
This URL allows an attacker to probe their database and drop tables.
</p>

<p>
It is said that one should never assume a website to be too
insignificant to get the attention of attackers. An attack of this kind
is not a matter of whether it will happen but when it will happen.
</p>

<p>
IncredibleIndia.org was attacked twice today but the website recovered
both the times. Perhaps the administrator recovered the dropped tables
from a backup. However, I am not sure if the administrator is aware of
the fact that the tables are being dropped by attackers.
