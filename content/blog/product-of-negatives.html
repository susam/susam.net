  A negative real number multiplied by a negative real number results
  in a positive real number.
</p>
<p>
  We learn this fact in school after our knowledge of numbers expand
  to include the negative real numbers.  We usually take this fact for
  granted.  In this post, we will prove it.
</p>
<p>
  In this discussion, we assume that we already know some basic
  properties of arithmetic operations such as the distributive
  property of multiplication over subtraction, existence of the
  additive inverse of real numbers, etc.
</p>
<p>
  We also take for granted the fact the product of a positive real
  number and a negative real number is a negative real number, i.e.,
  \( a \times (-b) = (-a) \times b = -(a \times b) \) where \( a \)
  and \( b \) are arbitrary positive real numbers.  We only want to
  show that the product of two negative real numbers must be positive,
  i.e., \( (-a) \times (-b) = a \times b \) where \( a \) and \( b \)
  are arbitrary positive real numbers.
</p>
<p>
  These assumptions help us to focus on the interesting parts of the
  arithmetic operations involved rather than getting bogged down in
  the details of every property of arithmetic operations we need to
  use.

<p>
  Let us first understand why the product of two negative numbers must
  be positive by taking a concrete example.  We start with something
  very ordinary, say,

  \[
    7 \times 8 = 56.
  \]

  Now let us rewrite \( 7 \) as \( (10 - 3) \) and \( 8 \) as \( (10 -
  2), \) so that we get

  \[
    (10 - 3) \times (10 - 2) = 56.
  \]

  Using the distributive property of multiplication over subtraction,
  we get

  \begin{align*}
    &amp; (10 - 3) \times 10 + (10 - 3) \times (-2) = 56 \\
    &amp; \iff 10 \times 10 + (-3) \times 10 + 10 \times (-2) + (-3) \times (-2) = 56 \\
    &amp; \iff 100 + (-30) + (-20) + (-3) \times (-2) = 56 \\
    &amp; \iff 50 + (-3) \times (-2) = 56 \\
    &amp; \iff 50 + (-3) \times (-2) - 50 = 56 - 50 \\
    &amp; \iff (-3) \times (-2) = 6.
  \end{align*}

  Hopefully, this builds some intuition regarding why negative \( 3 \)
  times negative \( 2 \) must be positive \( 6.  \) We see that \( (10
  - 3) \times (10 - 2) = 56 \) is true if and only if \( (-3) \times
  (-2) = 6.  \)
</p>
<p>
  This example demonstrates that the fact that the product of two
  negative real numbers is a positive real number definitely holds
  good for \( -3 \) and \( -2.  \) But does it hold good for any two
  arbitrary real numbers?
</p>
<h2 id="algebraic-proof">Algebraic Proof</h2>
<p>
  To show that the fact that the product of two negative real numbers
  is a positive real number holds good for all real numbers, we show
  that for any two positive real numbers \( a \) and \( b, \) \( (-a)
  \times (-b) = a \times b.  \) We know that

  \[
    a - a = 0.
  \]

  Multiplying both sides by \( -b, \) we get

  \[
    (a - a) \times (-b) = 0 \times (-b).
  \]

  Using the distributive property of multiplication over subtraction,
  we get

  \[
    a \times (-b) + (-a) \times (-b) = 0.
  \]

  We know that \( a \times (-b) = -(a \times b).  \) We are trying to
  find out what \( (-a) \times (-b) \) is.  Using what we know, we get

  \[
    -(a \times b) + (-a) \times (-b) = 0.
  \]

  Adding \( a \times b \) to both sides, we get

  \[
    (-a) \times (-b) = a \times b.
  \]
