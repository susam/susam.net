<!-- title: ADAC and HE Puzzles from GEB -->

I have been reading <em><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach"
class="title">G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid</a></em>
by Douglas R. Hofstadter for a few weeks. The book follows an
interesting format of alternating between chapters and dialogues between
imaginary charaters. In the words of the author:
<p>

<blockquote>
The long and the short of it is that I eventually decided -
but this took many months - that the optimal structure would be a strict
alternation between chapters and dialogues. Once that was clear, then I
had the joyous task of trying to pinpoint the most crucial ideas that I
wanted to get across to my readers and then somehow embodying them in
both the form and the content of fanciful, often punning dialogues
between Achilles and the Tortoise (plus a few new friends).
</blockquote>

<p>
After the second chapter (Chapter II: Meaning and Form in Mathematics)
there is a dialogue between Achilles and the Tortoise on telephone. The
title of the dialogue is <em>Sonata for Unaccompanied
Achilles</em>. The text shows the transcript of only one end of the
call, only what Achilles speaks. The Tortoise is at the far end of the
call. The sentences spoken by the Tortoise at the other end are not
present in the text. This makes the reading experience very interesting
as we keep guessing about what is going on at the other end.
</p>

<p>
It starts in this manner:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <em>Achilles:</em>
  Hello, this is Achilles.<br>

  <em>Achilles:</em>
  Oh, hello, Mr. T. How are you?<br>

  <em>Achilles:</em>
  A torticollis? Oh, I'm sorry to hear it. Do you have any idea what
  caused it?
</blockquote>

<p>
As the dialogue proceeds, they share a few puzzles. Here is the first
one from the Tortoise.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <em>Achilles:</em>
  A word with the letters 'A', 'D', 'A', 'C' consecutively inside it
  &hellip; Hmm &hellip; What about "abracadabra"?<br>

  <em>Achilles:</em>
  True, "ADAC" occurs backwards, not forwards, in that word.<br>

  <em>Achilles:</em>
  Hours and hours? It sounds like I'm in for a long puzzle, then. Where
  did you hear this infernal riddle?
</blockquote>

<p>
Here is the second puzzle from Achilles:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <em>Achilles:</em>
  Say, I once heard a word puzzle a little bit like this one. Do you
  want to hear it? Or would it just drive you further into
  distraction?<br>

  <em>Achilles:</em>
  I agree - can't do any harm. here it is: What's a word that begins
  with the letters "HE" and also ends with "HE"?<br>

  <em>Achilles:</em>
  Very ingenious - but that's almost cheating. It's certainly not what I
  meant!<br>

  <em>Achilles:</em>
  Of course you're right - it fulfills the conditions, but it's a sort
  of "degenerate" solution. There's another solution which I had in
  mind.<br>

  <em>Achilles:</em>
  That's exactly it!  How did you come up with it so fast?<br>

  <em>Achilles:</em>
  So here's a case where having a headache actually might have helped
  you, rather than hindering you. Excellent! But I'm still in the dark
  on your "ADAC" puzzle.
</blockquote>

<p>
<em>
If you want to think about these puzzles, this is a good time to pause
and think about them. There are spoilers ahead.
</em>
</p>

<p>
It didn't take much time for me to solve the puzzle because I cheated
with the word list file available on Linux distributions. Here is what I
found with my <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> system
(Debian 5.0).
</p>

<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>grep 'adac' /usr/share/dict/words</kbd>
headache
headache's
headaches
$ <kbd>grep '^he.*he$' /usr/share/dict/words</kbd>
headache
heartache</samp>
</pre>

<p>
The answers to both puzzles seem to be "HEADACHE". Take another look at
the last sentence in the dialogue above. It makes sense now as Achilles
says that having a <em>headache</em> might have helped the Tortoise.
</p>

<p>
Later in the dialogue the Tortoise offers <em>figure</em> and
<em>ground</em> as hints to the "ADAC" puzzle.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <em>Achilles:</em>
  Well, normally I don't like hints, but all right. What's your
  hint?<br>

  <em>Achilles:</em>
  I don't know what you mean by "figure" and "ground" in this case.<br>

  <em>Achilles:</em>
  Certainly I know Mosaic II! I know ALL of Escher's works. After all,
  he's my favorite artist. In any case, I've got a print of Mosaic II
  hanging on my wall, in plain view from here.<br>

  <em>Achilles:</em>
  Yes, I see all the black animals.<br>

  <em>Achilles:</em>
  Yes, I also see how their "negative" space - what's left out - defines
  the white animals.<br>

  <em>Achilles:</em>
  So THAT's what you mean by "figure" and "ground". But what does that
  have to do with the "ADAC" puzzle?<br>

  <em>Achilles:</em>
  Oh, this is too tricky to me. I think I'M starting to get a headache.
</blockquote>

<p>
The famous painting discussed in the dialogue can be found here: <a
href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/m-c-escher/mosaic-ii">https://www.wikiart.org/en/m-c-escher/mosaic-ii</a>.
We can see how the black animals form the <em>figure</em> (the positive
space) and how the background or <em>ground</em> (the negative space)
beautifully fits all the white animals.
</p>

<p>
The <em>figure</em> and <em>ground</em> in hints make sense now. The
first puzzle has "ADAC" in the question. Let us consider "ADAC" as the
figure or the positive space. If we remove "ADAC" from "HEADACHE",
we are left with the ground or negative space, which consists of "HE"
and "HE" at the beginning and the end of the word. The <em>figure</em>
is used in the first puzzle and the <em>ground</em> is used in the
second puzzle</p>

<p>
By the way, what is the first answer from the Tortoise that Achilles
finds very ingenious but degenerate? I believe, it is "HE" as this word
both begins and ends with "HE".
</p>

<p>
The funny thing about this dialogue is that both of them asked two
puzzles to each other without knowing that the answers to them were
the same. This is exactly what happened when a friend of mine and I
challenged each other with combinatorics puzzles. See this blog post for
the story: <a href="../combinatorial-coincidence/">Combinatorial
Coincidence</a>.
