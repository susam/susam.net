  What is the smallest CSS code we can write to print the Fizz Buzz
  sequence?  I think it can be done in four lines of CSS as shown below:
</p>
<pre>
<code>li { counter-increment: n }
li:not(:nth-child(5n))::before { content: counter(n) }
li:nth-child(3n)::before { content: "Fizz" }
li:nth-child(5n)::after { content: "Buzz" }</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Here is a complete working example:
  <a href="css-fizz-buzz.html">css-fizz-buzz.html</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I am neither a web developer nor a code-golfer.  I am just an
  ordinary programmer playing on the sea-shore and diverting myself in
  now and then finding a rougher pebble or an uglier shell than
  ordinary, whilst the great ocean of absurd contraptions lay all
  undiscovered before me.  Experienced code-golfers looking for a
  challenge can probably shrink this solution further.  However, such
  wizards are also likely to scoff at any mention of counting lines of
  code, since this mind sport treats such measures as pointless when
  all of CSS can be collapsed into a single line.  The number of bytes
  is probably more meaningful.  The code can also be minified slightly
  by removing all whitespace:
</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -sS https://susam.net/css-fizz-buzz.html | sed -n '/counter/,/after/p' | tr -d '[:space:]'
li{counter-increment:n}li:not(:nth-child(5n))::before{content:counter(n)}li:nth-child(3n)::before{content:"Fizz"}li:nth-child(5n)::after{content:"Buzz"}</code></pre>
<p>
  This minified version is composed of 152 characters:
</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -sS https://susam.net/css-fizz-buzz.html | sed -n '/counter/,/after/p' | tr -d '[:space:]' | wc -c
152</code></pre>
<p>
  If you manage to create a shorter solution, please do leave a
  comment.
