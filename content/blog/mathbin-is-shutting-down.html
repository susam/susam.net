  Thirteen years ago, on a quiet Saturday night, I sat down and began
  developing MathB.in.  After coding all through the night, as the sun
  rose on Sunday, 25 March 2012, the website was ready.  I registered
  a new domain name and shared it with a few friends who loved
  mathematics.  Back then, we spent hours discussing fascinating
  mathematics problems and this website became a simple way for us to
  share snippets with each other.  Word spread quickly&mdash;my
  friends shared it with their friends, who passed it along to others.
  The community grew organically.  Then, one day, I announced the
  project on the MathJax mailing list and its reach expanded even
  further.  Within a year, this mathematics pastebin service had users
  from around the world.  Watching the usage of this little project
  grow was an incredibly rewarding experience.

<p>
  The world has changed a lot since I first published MathB.in.  The
  internet has evolved and so have I.  Maintaining a mathematics
  pastebin service like this single-handedly has become increasingly
  difficult over the years.  Over the past 13 years, I have received
  notices from regulatory authorities whenever someone submitted
  content that triggered compliance concerns.  Each time, my server
  would be taken offline and I would be given a 7-day deadline to boot
  it into rescue mode, remove the offending content and restore
  service.  Missing the deadline would put my server hosting account
  at risk of cancellation.
</p>
<p>
  To prevent these disruptions, I began reviewing and filtering
  incoming content as much as possible every few days.  The
  appreciation and positive feedback from happy users kept me going.
  However, at this stage of my life, I can no longer afford to spend
  time moderating user content.  On top of that, the growing
  complexity of data protection and digital safety regulations places
  a significant burden on me as the maintainer of this service.
  Complying with these regulations requires considerable legal
  expertise that I cannot afford.
</p>
<p>
  Some might suggest that I could improve the spam-detection
  capabilities of this service and indeed, I have done so over the
  years.  However, all anti-spam measures are inherently
  probabilistic.  No matter how much automation is in place, a manual
  review of every post is still necessary to guarantee that all
  content is legitimate.  It only takes one dodgy submission to
  trigger compliance alerts.  While I respect the need for these
  regulations, I do not want to spend my weekends worrying about what
  users from around the world might be posting on this little pastebin
  service.  Nor do I want to be in a constant state of vigilance just
  to keep my server running.  It takes up more time than I can spare.
</p>
<p>
  Some have suggested forming a team of volunteers to review
  submissions, but that does not solve the core issue: since the
  server hosting account is in my name, I would still be responsible
  for remediating any compliance issues or risk having my account
  cancelled.  Another alternative is to move the service under a
  non-profit organisation, but with increased responsibilities in
  other areas of my life, handling the operational demands of such an
  endeavour is far beyond what I can commit to.  After all, this was
  meant to be a fun project built for me and my friends, not something
  that requires me to deal with regulatory issues.
</p>
<p>
  Another alternative would be to encode the content of a MathB.in
  post and embed it into the URL, which could then be distributed with
  others.  Upon visiting the URL, the application would read the
  encoded content from the URL, decode it and render it.  While this
  eliminates the need to store user content on my server, it
  introduces a new concern: the risk of someone sharing URLs with
  malicious content embedded in them.  I am not comfortable with such
  content being rendered on a page served from a domain that I am the
  registrant of.  The regulatory implications of rendering such
  content are also unclear.  I could still be held accountable for
  content rendered on the website, regardless of whether it's stored
  on the server.  This problem could be mitigated to some extent by
  refusing to render content containing known malicious patterns but
  no such solution can be foolproof.
</p>
<p>
  As a result, after much thought, I have regrettably made the
  decision to shut down MathB.in on Sunday, 16 March 2025.  The
  website will go offline on that day.  If you have any important
  posts that you would like to keep, now is the time to copy and save
  them for yourself.
</p>
<p>
  To all of you who have used this project, I want to express my
  sincere gratitude.  Running a project that could serve you in a
  meaningful way has given me a strong sense of accomplishment and
  pride.  To those who are disappointed by this service's closure, I
  am sorry.  I wish I could continue to dedicate the time and effort
  needed to maintain and develop it, but I must acknowledge my
  limitations and step away from a project that has become an artefact
  of my past, not my present.
