  Consider the following infinite grid of numbers, where the numbers
  are arranged in a spiral-like manner, but the spiral reverses
  direction each time it reaches the edge of the grid:

  \begin{array}{rcrcrcrcrl}
      1 &amp; \rt &amp;   2 &amp; \sp &amp;   9 &amp; \rt &amp;  10 &amp; \sp &amp;  25 &amp; \cd \\

  Can we find a closed-form expression that tells us the number at the
  \( m \)th row and \( n \)th column?

  Before we explore this problem further, let us rewrite the zigzag
  number spiral grid in a cleaner form, omitting the arrows:

  \begin{array}{rrrrrl}
      1 &amp;   2 &amp;   9  &amp;  10 &amp;  25 &amp; \cd \\
      4 &amp;   3 &amp;   8  &amp;  11 &amp;  24 &amp; \cd \\
      5 &amp;   6 &amp;   7  &amp;  12 &amp;  23 &amp; \cd \\
     16 &amp;  15 &amp;  14  &amp;  13 &amp;  22 &amp; \cd \\
     17 &amp;  18 &amp;  19  &amp;  20 &amp;  21 &amp; \cd \\
    \vd &amp; \vd &amp; \vd  &amp; \vd &amp; \vd &amp; \dd
  \end{array}

  Let \( f(m, n) \) denote the number at the \( m \)th row and
  \( n \)th column.  For example, \( f(1, 1) = 1 \) and \( f(2, 5) =
  24 \).  We want to find a closed-form expression for \( f(m, n) \).
</p>
<p>
  Let us first clarify what we mean by a <em>closed-form
  expression</em>.  There is no universal definition of a closed-form
  expression, but the term typically refers to a mathematical
  expression involving variables and constants, built using a finite
  combination of basic operations: addition, subtraction,
  multiplication, division, integer exponents, roots with integer
  index and functions such as exponentials, logarithms and
  trigonometric functions.
</p>
<p>
  In this article, however, we need only addition, subtraction,
  division, squares and square roots.  This may be a bit of a spoiler,
  but I must mention that the \( \max \) function appears in the
  closed-form expressions we are about to see.  If you are concerned
  about whether functions like \( \max \) and \( \min \) are permitted
  in such expressions, note that

  \begin{align*}
    \max(m, n) &amp; = \frac{m + n + \sqrt{(m - n)^2}}{2}, \\
    \min(m, n) &amp; = \frac{m + n - \sqrt{(m - n)^2}}{2}.
  \end{align*}

  So \( \max \) and \( \min \) are simply shorthand for expressions
  involving addition, subtraction, division, squares and square roots.
  In the discussion that follows, we will use only the \( \max \)
  function.
</p>
<h2 id="patterns-on-the-edges">Patterns on the Edges</h2>
<p>
  Let us begin by analysing the edge numbers.  Number the rows as \(
  1, 2, 3 \dots \) and the columns likewise.  Observe where the spiral
  touches the left edge and changes direction.  This happens only on
  even-numbered rows.  Similarly, each time the spiral touches the top
  edge and changes direction, it does so on odd-numbered columns.  In
  the following subsections, we take a closer look at this behaviour
  of the spiral.
</p>
<p>
  I should mention that this section takes a rather long path to
  arrive at the closed-form solution.  Personally, I enjoy such long
  tours.  If you prefer a more direct approach, feel free to skip
  ahead to
  <a href="#patterns-on-the-diagonal">Patterns on the Diagonal</a> for
  a shorter discussion that reaches the same result.
</p>
<h3 id="computing-edge-numbers">Computing Edge Numbers</h3>
<p>
  Each time the spiral reaches the left edge of the grid, it does so
  at some \( m \)th row where \( m \) is even.  The \( m \times m \)
  subgrid formed by the first \( m \) rows and the first \( m \)
  columns contains \( m^2 \) consecutive numbers.  Since the numbers
  strictly increase as the spiral grows, the largest of these
  \( m^2 \) numbers must appear at the position where the spiral
  touches the left edge.  This is illustrated in the figure below.
</p>
<figure>
  \begin{array}{rrrr:rl}

  \end{array}
  <figcaption>
    The spiral touches the left edge on the \( 4 \)th row where the
    number is \( 4^2 \)
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  Whenever the spiral touches the left edge at the \( m \)th row
  (where \( m \) is even), the number in the first column of that row
  is \( m^2 \).  Hence, we conclude that \( f(m, 1) = m^2 \) when
  \( m \) is even.  Immediately after touching the left edge, the
  spiral turns downwards into the first column of the next row.  Thus,
  in the next row, i.e., in the \( (m + 1) \)th row, we have \( f(m +
  1, 1) = m^2 + 1 \), where \( m + 1 \) is odd.  This can be restated
  as \( f(m, 1) = (m - 1)^2 + 1 \) when \( m \) is odd.  Since \( f(1,
  1) = 1 \), we can summarise the two formulas we have found here as:

  \[
    f(m, 1) =
      \begin{cases}
        m^2           &amp; \text{if } m \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
        (m - 1)^2 + 1 &amp; \text{if } m \equiv 1 \pmod{2}.
      \end{cases}
  \]
</p>
<p>
  We can perform a similar analysis for the numbers at the top edge
  and note that whenever the spiral touches the top edge at the
  \( n \)th column (where \( n \) is odd), the number in the first row
  of that column is \( n^2 \).  This is illustrated below.
</p>

  <figcaption>
    The spiral touches the top edge on the \( 3 \)rd column where the
    number is \( 3^2 \)
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  Immediately after touching the top edge, the spiral turns right into
  the next column.  These observations give us the following formula
  for the numbers at the top edge:

  \[
    f(1, n) =
      \begin{cases}
        n^2           &amp; \text{if } n \equiv 1 \pmod{2}, \\
        (n - 1)^2 + 1 &amp; \text{if } n \equiv 0 \pmod{2}.
      \end{cases}
  \]

  Next we will find a formula for any arbitrary number anywhere in the
  grid.
</p>
<h3 id="computing-all-grid-numbers-1">Computing All Grid Numbers</h3>
<p>
 Since the spiral touches the left edge on even-numbered rows, then
 turns downwards into the next (odd-numbered) row and then starts
 moving right until the diagonal (where it changes direction again),
 the following two rules hold:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    On every odd-numbered row, as we go from left to right, the
    numbers increase until we reach the diagonal.
  </li>
  <li>
    On every even-numbered row, as we go from left to right, the
    numbers decrease until we reach the diagonal.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Note that all the numbers we considered in the above two points lie
  on or below the diagonal (or equivalently, on or to the left of the
  diagonal).  Therefore, on an odd-numbered row, we can find the
  numbers on or below the diagonal using the formula \( f(m, n) = f(m,
  1) + (n - 1) \), where \( m \) is odd.  Similarly, on even-numbered
  rows, we can find the numbers on or below the diagonal using the
  formula \( f(m, n) = f(m, 1) - (n - 1) \), where \( m \) is even.
</p>
<p>
  By a similar analysis, the following rules hold when we consider the
  numbers in a column:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    On every even-numbered column, as we go from top to bottom, the
    numbers increase until we reach the diagonal.
  </li>
  <li>
    On every odd-numbered column, as we go from top to bottom, the
    numbers decrease until we reach the diagonal.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Now the numbers on or above the diagonal can be found using the
  formula \( f(m, n) = f(1, n) - (m - 1) \) when \( n \) is odd and \(
  f(m, n) = f(1, n) + (m - 1) \), when \( n \) is even.
</p>
<p>
  Can we determine from the values of \( m \) and \( n \) if the
  number \( f(m, n) \) is above the diagonal or below it?  Yes, if \(
  m \le n \), then \( f(m, n) \) lies on or above the diagonal.
  However, if \( m \ge n \), then \( f(m, n) \) lies on or below the
  diagonal.
</p>
<p>
  We now have everything we need to write a general formula for
  finding the numbers anywhere in the grid.  Using the four formulas
  and the two inequalities obtained in this section, we get

  \[
    f(m, n) =
      \begin{cases}
        f(1, n) + (m - 1)
        &amp; \text{if } m \le n \text{ and } n \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
        f(1, n) - (m - 1)
        &amp; \text{if } m \le n \text{ and } n \equiv 1 \pmod{2}, \\
        f(m, 1) - (n - 1)
        &amp; \text{if } m \ge n \text{ and } m \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
        f(m, 1) + (n - 1)
        &amp; \text{if } m \ge n \text{ and } m \equiv 1 \pmod{2}.  \\
      \end{cases}
  \]

  Using the equations for \( f(1, n) \) and \( f(m, 1) \) from the
  previous section, the above formulas can be rewritten as

  \[
    f(m, n) =
      \begin{cases}
        (n - 1)^2 + 1 + (m - 1)
        &amp; \text{if } m \le n \text{ and } n \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
        n^2 - (m - 1)
        &amp; \text{if } m \le n \text{ and } n \equiv 1 \pmod{2}, \\
        m^2 - (n - 1)
        &amp; \text{if } m \ge n \text{ and } m \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
        (m - 1)^2 + 1 + (n - 1)
        &amp; \text{if } m \ge n \text{ and } m \equiv 1 \pmod{2}.  \\
      \end{cases}
  \]

  Simplifying the expressions on the right-hand side, we get

  \[
    f(m, n) =
      \begin{cases}
        (n - 1)^2 + m
        &amp; \text{if } m \le n \text{ and } n \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
        n^2 - m + 1
        &amp; \text{if } m \le n \text{ and } n \equiv 1 \pmod{2}, \\
        m^2 - n + 1
        &amp; \text{if } m \ge n \text{ and } m \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
        (m - 1)^2 + n
        &amp; \text{if } m \ge n \text{ and } m \equiv 1 \pmod{2}.  \\
      \end{cases}
  \]

  This is pretty good.  We now have a piecewise formula that works for
  any position in the grid.  Let us now explore whether we can express
  it as a single closed-form expression.
</p>
<h3 id="closed-form-expression-1">Closed Form Expression</h3>
<p>
  First, we will rewrite the piecewise formula from the previous
  section in the following form:

  \[
    f(m, n) =
      \begin{cases}
        (n^2 - n + 1) + (m - n)
        &amp; \text{if } m \le n \text{ and } n \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
        (n^2 - n + 1) - (m - n)
        &amp; \text{if } m \le n \text{ and } n \equiv 1 \pmod{2}, \\
        (m^2 - m + 1) + (m - n)
        &amp; \text{if } m \ge n \text{ and } m \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
        (m^2 - m + 1) - (m - n)
        &amp; \text{if } m \ge n \text{ and } m \equiv 1 \pmod{2}.  \\
      \end{cases}
  \]

  This is the same formula, rewritten to reveal common patterns
  between the four expressions on the right-hand side.  In each
  expression, one variable plays the dominant role, occurring several
  times, while the other appears only once.  For example, in the first
  two expressions, \( n \) plays the dominant role whereas \( m \)
  occurs only once.  If we look closely, we realise that it is the
  variable that is greater than or equal to the other that plays the
  dominant role.  Therefore the first and third expressions may be
  written as

  \[
    \left( (\max(m, n))^2 - \max(m, n) + 1 \right) + (m - n).
  \]

  Similarly, the second and fourth expressions may be written as

  \[
    \left( (\max(m, n))^2 - \max(m, n) + 1 \right) - (m - n).
  \]

  We have made some progress towards a closed-form expression.  We
  have collapsed the four expressions in the piecewise formula to just
  two.  The only difference between them lies in the sign of the
  second term: it is positive when the dominant variable is even and
  negative when it is odd.  This observation allows us to unify both
  cases into a single expression:

  \[
    f(m, n) = (\max(m, n))^2 - \max(m, n) + 1 + (-1)^{\max(m, n)} (m - n).
  \]

  Now we have a closed-form expression for \( f(m, n) \) that gives
  the number at any position in the grid.
</p>
<h2 id="patterns-on-the-diagonal">Patterns on the Diagonal</h2>
<p>
  As mentioned earlier, there is a shorter route to the same
  closed-form expression.  This alternative approach is based on
  analysing the numbers along the diagonal of the grid.  We still need
  to examine the edge numbers, but not all of them as we did in the
  previous section.  Some of the reasoning about edge values will be
  repeated here to ensure this section is self-contained.
</p>
<h3 id="computing-diagonal-numbers">Computing Diagonal Numbers</h3>
<p>
  A number on the diagonal has the same row number and column number.
  In other words, a diagonal number has the value \( f(n, n) \) for
  some positive integer \( n \).  Consider the case when \( n \) is
  even.  In this case, the diagonal number is on a segment of the
  spiral that is moving to the left.  The \( n \times n \) subgrid
  formed by the first \( n \) rows and the first \( n \) columns
  contains exactly \( n^2 \) consecutive numbers.  Since the diagonal
  number is on the last row of this subgrid and the numbers in this
  row increase as we move from right to left, the largest number in
  the subgrid must be on the left edge of this row.  Therefore the
  number at the left edge is \( f(n, 1) = n^2 \), where \( n \) is
  even.  This is illustrated below.
</p>

    The spiral touches the left edge on the \( 4 \)th row where the
    number is \( 4^2 \)
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  From the diagonal to the edge of the subgrid, there are \( n \)
  consecutive numbers.  In a sequence of \( n \) consecutive numbers,
  the difference between the maximum number and the minimum number is
  \( n - 1 \).  Therefore, \( n^2 - f(n, n) = n - 1 \).  This gives us

  \[
    f(n, n) = n^2 - n + 1 \quad \text{if } n \equiv 0 \pmod{2}.
  \]
</p>
<p>
  Now consider the case when \( n \) is odd.

    The spiral touches the top edge on the \( 3 \)rd column where the
    number is \( 3^2 \)
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  By a similar reasoning, for odd \( n \), the \( n \)th column has
  numbers that increase as we move up from the diagonal number towards
  the top edge.  Therefore \( f(1, n) = n^2 \) and since \( n^2 - f(n,
  n) = n - 1 \), we again obtain

  \[
    f(n, n) = n^2 - n + 1 \quad \text{if } n \equiv 1 \pmod{2}.
  \]

  Since \( f(n, n) \) takes the same form for both odd and even
  \( n \), we can write

  \[
    f(n, n) = n^2 - n + 1
  \]

  for all positive integers \( n \).
</p>
<h3 id="computing-all-grid-numbers-2">Computing All Grid Numbers</h3>
<p>
  If \( m \le n \), then the number \( f(m, n) \) lies on or above the
  diagonal number \( f(n, n) \).  If \( n \) is even, then the numbers
  decrease as we go from the diagonal up to the top edge.  Therefore
  \( f(m, n) \le f(n, n) \) and \( f(m, n) = f(n, n) - (n - m) \).  If
  \( n \) is odd, then the numbers increase as we go from the diagonal
  up to the top edge and therefore \( f(m, n) \ge f(n, n) \) and \(
  f(m, n) = f(n, n) + (n - m) \).
</p>
<p>
  If \( m \ge n \), then the number \( f(m, n) \) lies on or below the
  diagonal number \( f(m, m) \).  By a similar analysis, we find that
  \( f(m, n) = f(m, m) + (m - n) \) if \( n \) is even and \( f(m, n)
  = f(m, m) - (m - n) \) if \( n \) is odd.  We summarise these
  results as follows:

  \[
    f(m, n) =
      \begin{cases}
        f(n, n) - (n - m)
        &amp; \text{if } m \le n \text{ and } n \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
        f(n, n) + (n - m)
        &amp; \text{if } m \le n \text{ and } n \equiv 1 \pmod{2}, \\
        f(m, m) + (m - n)
        &amp; \text{if } m \ge n \text{ and } m \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
        f(m, m) - (m - n)
        &amp; \text{if } m \ge n \text{ and } m \equiv 1 \pmod{2}.  \\
      \end{cases}
  \]

  Note that the above formula can be rewritten as

  \[
    f(m, n) =
      \begin{cases}
        f(n, n) + (m - n)

  If we take a close look at the last formula in the previous section,
  we find that in each expression, one variable plays a dominant role,
  i.e., it occurs more frequently in the expression than the other.
  In the first two expressions \( n \) plays the dominant role whereas
  in the last two expressions \( m \) plays the dominant role.  In
  fact, in each expression, the dominant variable is the one that is
  greater than or equal to the other.  With this in mind, we can
  rewrite the above formula as

  \[
    f(m, n) =
      \begin{cases}
        f(\max(m, n), \max(m, n)) + (m - n)
        &amp; \text{if } \max(m, n) \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
        f(\max(m, n), \max(m, n)) - (m - n)
        &amp; \text{if } \max(m, n) \equiv 1 \pmod{2}.  \\
      \end{cases}
  \]

  The only difference between the expressions is the sign of the
  second term: it is positive when \( \max(m, n) \) is even and
  negative when \( \max(m, n) \) is odd.  As a result, we can rewrite
  the above formula as a single expression like this:

  \[
    f(m, n) = f(\max(m, n), \max(m, n)) + (-1)^{\max(m, n)} (m - n).
  \]

  Using the formula \( f(n, n) = n^2 - n + 1 \) from the previous
  section, we get

  \[
    f(m, n) = (\max(m, n))^2 - \max(m, n) + 1 + (-1)^{\max(m, n)} (m - n).
  \]

  We arrive again at the same closed-form expression, this time by
  focusing on the diagonal of the grid.
