<!-- title: Live Demo of Orkut Session Hijacking -->

On 22 June 2007, I posted a full-disclosure regarding an <a
href="https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2007/Jun/455">Orkut session
management issue</a>. A week later, on 29 June 2007, I posted another
full-disclosure regarding a similar <a
href="https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2007/Jun/609">Google session
management issue</a>. The cause of both the issues are same.
The session associated with a user is not invalidated at the server-side
even after the user logs out. This is a security flaw.

A couple of days later, on the basis of these posts, <a
href="https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2007/Jun/650">a live
demonstration of Orkut session hijacking</a> was posted by another
member of the same mailing list. A week later, <a
href="https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2007/Jul/125">interim
results</a> were published that showed that Orkut sessions remain alive
for at least 7 days even after the user logs out. Another week later, <a
href="https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2007/Jul/296">final
results</a> were published that showed that Orkut sessions remain alive
for 14 days even after the user logs out.

This issue by itself is not critical because a successful exploit
requires the attacker to steal the session cookie of a victim before
the victim's session can be hijacked. However this is still a moderately
serious flaw because if the attacker manages to steal the session cookie
of a victim, say by finding a cross-scripting (XSS) flaw before this
flaw is fixed or by any other means, then there is no way for the
victim to terminate the session due to this flaw. Normally, if a victim
suspects that his/her session is hijacked he/she can invalidate the
session cookie by simply logging out of his/her own session which would
terminate the session both for the victim and the attacker. However due
to this flaw, the session cookie remains valid even after the victim
logs out and the attacker can continue to use the victim's session for a
period of 14 days.
