  How many different ways can we place two identical knights on an \(
  n \times n \) chessboard so that they attack each other?  Can we
  find a closed-form expression that gives this number?  This is the
  problem we explore in this article.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>
  A knight moves two squares in one direction, then one square
  perpendicular to it, forming an L-shaped path.  If a piece occupies
  the destination square, the knight captures it.  If two knights are
  placed such that each can capture the other in a single move, then
  we say the knights attack each other.  We want to determine the
  number of ways to place two identical knights on an \( n \times n \)
  chessboard so that they attack each other.

  The above illustration shows just one of several ways two knights
  can attack each other on a \( 3 \times 3 \) board.  There are, in
  fact, a total of eight such placements, shown below.

    All \( 8 \) ways two identical knights can attack each other on a
    \( 3 \times 3 \) board.

</figure>
<p>
  Let \( f(n) \) denote the number of ways we can place two identical
  knights on an \( n \times n \) chessboard such that they attack each
  other, where \( n \ge 1 \).
</p>
<p>
  A \( 1 \times 1 \) board has room for only one knight, so we define
  \( f(1) = 0 \).  On a \( 2 \times 2 \) board, a knight cannot move
  two squares in any direction and therefore cannot attack.
  Therefore, \( f(2) = 0 \).  To summarise,

  \[
    f(1) = f(2) = 0.
  \]

  From the illustration above, we see that \( f(3) = 8 \).  We want to
  find a closed-form expression for \( f(n) \).
</p>
<p>
  We will analyse this problem from various perspectives.  We begin
  with a couple of needlessly complicated approaches, followed by a
  simple and elegant solution.  While I personally enjoy these
  long-winded explorations, if you prefer a more direct solution,
  please skip ahead
  to <a href="#counting-placements-from-minimal-attack-sections">Counting
  Placements From Minimal Attack Sections</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Before we proceed, let us introduce the term <em>mutually attacking
  knight placement</em> to mean a placement of two knights on the
  chessboard such that they attack each other.  Unless stated
  otherwise, the two knights are identical.  This term will serve as a
  convenient shorthand for referring to such placements.
</p>
<h2 id="counting-placements-as-the-board-grows">Counting Placements as the Board Grows</h2>
<p>
  We now turn to the needlessly complicated solution promised in the
  previous section.  We analyse the <em>new</em> mutually attacking
  knight placements introduced when an existing board is enlarged by
  adding a row and a column.
</p>
<p>
  Let us define

  \[
    \Delta f(n) = f(n) - f(n - 1)
  \]

  for \( n \ge 2 \), so that \( \Delta f(n) \) denotes the new
  mutually attacking knight placements introduced when an \( (n - 1)
  \times (n - 1) \) board is expanded to size \( n \times n \) by
  adding one row and one column.
</p>
<p>
  For brevity, we will avoid restating the process of enlarging an \(
  (n - 1) \times (n - 1) \) board to an \( n \times n \) board by
  adding one row and one column whenever we refer to new placements.
  Instead, we use the term <em>new placements</em> on an
  \( n \times n \) board to refer to \( \Delta f(n) \).  It is to be
  understood that these new placements are the mutually attacking
  knight placements introduced by enlarging the board from size \( (n
  - 1) \times (n - 1) \) to \( n \times n \).
</p>
<p>
  Without loss of generality, suppose the new row and column are added
  to the bottom and right respectively.  We already know that

  \begin{align*}
    \Delta f(2) &amp; = f(2) - f(1) = 0 - 0 = 0, \\
    \Delta f(3) &amp; = f(3) - f(2) = 8 - 0 = 8.  \\
  \end{align*}

  We will now find \( \Delta f(n) \) for \( n \ge 4 \).  To do this,
  we first categorise the newly added squares due to board expansion,
  into four types, as illustrated below.

    New squares, labelled by type, as the board size increases from \(

</figure>
<p>
  Here is a brief description of each square type:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Type A squares are the three new corner squares.
  </li>
  <li>
    Type B squares are the two new squares adjacent to type A squares
    at the top and left edges.
  </li>
  <li>
    Type C squares are the new squares that are <em>not</em> adjacent
    to any type A square.  If the new board has dimensions \( n \times
    n \), where \( n \ge 4 \), then there are exactly \( 2n - 8 \)
    squares of type C.
  </li>
  <li>
    Type D squares are the two new squares adjacent to the
    bottom-right type A square.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  We now calculate how many new mutually attacking knight placements
  are introduced by these additional squares as the board expands.  We
  proceed with a case-by-case analysis for each square type.
</p>
<h3 id="type-a-squares">Type A Squares</h3>
<p>
  There are three squares of type A.  If we place one knight on a type
  A square, there are two positions for the second knight such that
  the two knights attack each other.

<h3 id="type-c-squares">Type C Squares</h3>
<p>
  The number of type C squares depends on the board size.  When we
  increase the size of a board from \( (n - 1) \times (n - 1) \) to
  \(n \times n \), where \( n \ge 4 \), we add \( n^2 - (n - 1)^2 = 2n
  - 1 \) new squares.  Among these, \( 3 \) are of type A, \( 2 \) are
  of type B and \( 2 \) are of type D.  That gives us a total of \(
  7 \) squares of type A, B or D.  The remaining \( 2n - 1 - 7 = 2n -
  8 \) squares are therefore of type C.  Note that when the board size
  increases from \( 3 \times 3 \) to \( 4 \times 4 \), there are \( 2
  \times 4 - 8 = 0 \) squares of type C.

<p>
  For example, when we increase the board size from \( 3 \times 3 \)
  to \( 4 \times 4 \), both the placements described in the previous
  paragraph appear while analysing the placements with a knight on a
  type B square.  More generally, for any board of size
  \( n \times n \) with \( n \ge 5 \), these placements occur while
  analysing the placements with a knight on a type C square.
  Therefore the total number of new mutually attacking knight
  placements is \( 2 \times 3 - 2 = 4 \).

<p>
  If we add the number of new mutually attacking knight placements
  found in each of the cases above, we get

  \[
    \Delta f(n) = 6 + 6 + 8(n - 4) + 4 = 8(n - 2)
  \]

  new mutually attacking knight placements as the board size increases
  from \( (n - 1) \times (n - 1) \) to \( n \times n \), where \( n
  \ge 4 \).  We already know that \( \Delta f(2) = 0 \) and \( \Delta
  f(3) = 8 \).  Surprisingly, the above formula produces the correct
  values for those cases as well.  Therefore, we can generalise this
  result as

  \[
    \Delta f(n) = 8(n - 2)
  \]

  for all \( n \ge 2 \).  We can now calculate \( f(n) \) for \( n \ge
  1 \) as follows:

  \begin{align*}
    f(n)
    &amp; = \sum_{k = 1}^n f(k) - \sum_{k = 1}^{n - 1} f(k) \\
    &amp; = \sum_{k = 1}^n f(k) - \sum_{k = 2}^n f(k - 1) \\
    &amp; = f(1) + \sum_{k = 2}^n (f(k) - f(k - 1)) \\
    &amp; = f(1) + \sum_{k = 2}^n \Delta f(k) \\
    &amp; = 0 + \sum_{k = 2}^n 8(k - 2) \\
    &amp; = 8 \sum_{k = 0}^{n - 2} k \\
    &amp; = \frac{8(n - 2)(n - 1)}{2} \\
    &amp; = 4(n - 1)(n - 2).
  \end{align*}

  To summarise, we now have a closed form expression for \( f(n) \).
  For all \( n \ge 1 \), we have

  \[
    f(n) = 4(n - 1)(n - 2).
  \]

<h2 id="counting-placements-for-each-square">Counting Placements for Each Square</h2>
<p>
  The previous section took a long-winded path to arrive at a closed
  form expression for \( f(n) \).  In this section, we will reach the
  same result that is still a bit drawn out, but not quite as much as
  before.
</p>
<p>
  This time, instead of looking only at the new squares created when
  the board grows, we consider <em>every</em> square on the board.  To
  make the counting easier, we no longer treat the knights as
  identical.  We first work with two distinct knights, count the
  mutually attacking knight placements and then divide the total by \(
  2 \) to get the result for identical knights.
</p>
<h3 id="attacking-degrees-of-squares">Attacking Degrees of Squares</h3>
<p>
  Here, we introduce the term <em>attacking degree of a square</em> to
  mean the number of squares a knight can move to from that square in
  a single move.  In other words, the attacking degree of a square is
  the number of squares that would be attacked if a knight were placed
  on it.  For example, the corner squares have an attacking degree of
  \( 2 \).

  With eight such squares, we get \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \) mutually
  attacking knight placements when the two knights are distinct.  If
  we divide this number by \( 2 \), we get \( 8 \) which is indeed the
  number of mutually attacking knight placements on a \( 3 \times 3 \)
  board when the two knights are identical.  This matches the earlier
  result \( f(3) = 8 \).
</p>
<h3 id="from-attacking-degrees-to-counting-placements">From Attacking Degrees to Counting Placements</h3>
<p>
  Let \( g(n) \) be the number of mutually attacking knight placements
  on an \( n \times n \) board when the knights are distinct.  Then \(
  g(n) \) is simply the sum of the attacking degrees of all squares on
  the board.  As before, let \( f(n) \) denote the number of mutually
  attacking knight placements on an \( n \times n \) board when the
  two knights are identical.  We will now show that
  \( f(n) = g(n)/2 \).
</p>
<p>
  Label all squares of the \( n \times n \) board as \( S_1, S_2,
  \dots, S_{n^2} \) in any fixed order.  Label the two distinct
  knights as \( N_1 \) and \( N_2 \).  We represent each mutually
  attacking knight placement as an ordered pair \( (S_i, S_j) \) if \(
  N_1 \) is on \( S_i \) and \( N_2 \) is on \( S_j \), with the two
  knights attacking each other.  Here \( 1 \le i, j \le n^2 \) and \(
  i \ne j \).
</p>
<p>
  Let \( M \) be the set of all mutually attacking knight placements
  for distinct knights on an \( n \times n \) board.  Then

  \[
    g(n) = \lvert M \rvert.
  \]

  If \( (S_i, S_j) \) is a mutually attacking knight placement of the
  distinct knights \( N_1 \) and \( N_2 \) for some \( i \) and
  \( j \) with \( 1 \le i, j \le n^2 \) and \( i \ne j \), then \(
  (S_j, S_i) \) is also a mutually attacking knight placement, since
  swapping the positions of the two mutually attacking knights still
  yields a valid mutually attacking placement.  Therefore

  \[
    (S_i, S_j) \in M \iff (S_j, S_i) \in M.
  \]

  Each ordered placement \( (S_i, S_j) \) in \( M \) is thus paired
  with the ordered placement \( (S_j, S_i) \).  When the knights are
  identical, the two arrangements are indistinguishable and count as
  one placement.  Hence, the number of mutually attacking placements
  for identical knights is exactly half of the number for distinct
  knights, i.e.

  \[
    f(n) = \frac{g(n)}{2}.
  \]

  The next subsection focuses on calculating \( g(n) \), from which \(
  f(n) \) follows immediately by the above formula.
</p>
<h3 id="closed-form-expression-2">Closed Form Expression</h3>
<p>
  As noted in the previous section, the number of mutually attacking
  knight placements for two distinct knights on an \( n \times n \)
  board is simply the sum of attacking degrees of all squares on the
  board.  If we label each square as discussed in the previous section
  and use the notation \( \deg(S_i) \) for the attacking degree of the
  square labelled \( S_i \), where \( 1 \le i \le n^2 \), then

  \[
    g(n) = \sum_{i=1}^{n^2} \deg(S_i).
  \]

  Recall that the attacking degree of a square is the number of
  squares a knight could attack if it were placed there.  Earlier, we
  saw that on a \( 3 \times 3 \) board, all squares except the centre
  one have attacking degree \( 2 \), which gives \( g(3) = 8 \times 2
  = 16 \) and \( f(3) = g(3)/2 = 8 \).  Let us now write down the
  attacking degrees of all squares on a \( 4 \times 4 \) board.

    Attacking degrees of all squares on a \( 6 \times 6 \) board

<p>
  From this illustration, we get

  \begin{align*}
    g(6) &amp; = 4 \times 2 + 8 \times 3 + 12 \times 4 + 8 \times 6 + 4 \times 8 = 160.  \\
    f(6) &amp; = g(6)/2 = 80.
  \end{align*}

  Let us find a general formula now for \( n \ge 4 \).  We introduce
  one more notation.  Let \( D_k(n) \) denote the sum of the attacking
  degrees of all squares of attacking degree \( k \) on an \( n \times
  n \) board, i.e.

  \[
    D_k(n) = \sum_{\mathclap{\deg(S_i) = k}} \deg(S_i).
  \]

  Since the only attacking degrees the squares can have are \( 2, 3,
  4, 6 \) and \( 8 \), the sum of the attacking degrees of all squares
  can be written as

  \[
    g(n) = D_2(n) + D_3(n) + D_4(n) + D_6(n) + D_8(n).
  \]

  There are exactly four squares of attacking degree \( 2 \).  These
  are the corner ones.  Therefore,

  \[
    D_2(n) = 4 \times 2 = 8.
  \]

  The eight squares adjacent to the corner squares have attacking
  degree \( 3 \).  Therefore,

  \[
    D_3(n) = 8 \times 3 = 24.
  \]

  Let us define an <em>inner corner square</em> as one that shares a
  corner with a corner square but not an edge with it.  There are four
  inner corner squares and each has attacking degree \( 4 \).
  Further, each row and column on the outer edge contains \( n - 4 \)
  additional squares with attacking degree \( 4 \).  Therefore,

  \[
    D_4(n) = (4 + 4(n - 4))(4) = 16(n - 3).
  \]

  Consider a row or column that contains two inner corner squares of
  attacking degree \( 4 \).  All \( n - 4 \) squares between the inner
  corner squares have attacking degree \( 6 \).  There are two such
  rows and two such columns.  Therefore,

  \[
    D_6(n) = 4(n - 4)(6) = 24(n - 4).
  \]

  We have counted the attacking degrees of all squares in the first
  two columns and rows as well as the last two columns and rows.  We
  are left with \( (n - 4)^2 \) squares in the middle and they all
  have attacking degree \( 8 \).  Therefore,

  \[
    D_8(n) = 8(n - 4)^2.
  \]

  Therefore,

  \begin{align*}
    g(n)
    &amp; = D_2(n) + D_3(n) + D_4(n) + D_6(n) + D_8(n) \\
    &amp; = 8 + 24 + 16(n - 3) + 24(n - 4) + 8(n - 4)^2 \\
    &amp; = 8(n - 1)(n - 2).
  \end{align*}

  Even though we assumed \( n \ge 4 \) while obtaining the above
  formula, remarkably, it gives us the correct values for \( n = 1,
  2 \) and \( 3 \).  The number of mutually attacking knight
  placements for distinct knights on an \( n \times n \) board is \(
  0 \) if \( n = 1 \) or \( 2 \).  It is \( 16 \) if \( n = 3 \).
  Indeed the above formula gives us

  \[
    g(1) = g(2) = 0, \quad g(3) = 16.
  \]

  Therefore, we can now generalise the above result as

  \[
    g(n) = 8(n - 1)(n - 2)
  \]

  for all \( n \ge 1 \).  Therefore, for all \( n \ge 1 \),

  \[
    f(n) = \frac{g(n)}{2} = 4(n - 1)(n - 2).
  \]

  Finally, in this section, we take a look at a simple and elegant

</figure>
<p>
  We call these \( 2 \times 3 \) and \( 3 \times 2 \) sections
  the <em>minimal attack sections</em> of a board, since no smaller
  section can contain a mutually attacking knight placement.
</p>
<p>
  Two distinct \( 2 \times 3 \) sections can share at most a \( 1
  \times 3 \) section, which is smaller than a minimal attack section.
  Consequently, no mutually attacking knight placement can be common
  to two distinct \( 2 \times 3 \) sections of a board.
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, two distinct \( 3 \times 2 \) sections can share at most
  a \( 3 \times 1 \) section, again too small to contain a minimal
  attack section.  Therefore, they share no mutually attacking knight
  placement.
</p>
<p>
  A \( 2 \times 3 \) section and a \( 3 \times 2 \) section can share
  at most a \( 2 \times 2 \) section, which is still smaller than a
  minimal attack section, so they share no mutually attacking knight
  placement either.
</p>
<p>
  To summarise, any two minimal attack sections of the board yield
  distinct pairs of mutually attacking knight placements.  The total
  number of such placements is therefore exactly twice the number of
  minimal attack sections on the board.
</p>
<h3 id="closed-form-expression-3">Closed Form Expression</h3>
<p>
  In an \( n \times n \) board where \( n \ge 3 \), the left edge of a
  \( 2 \times 3 \) section can be placed in any one of the first \( n
  - 2 \) columns of the board.  Similarly, the top edge of such a
  section can be placed in any one of the first \( n - 1 \) rows of
  the board.  Therefore, the total number of distinct \( 2 \times 3 \)
  sections on the board is \( (n - 2)(n - 1) \).
</p>
<p>
  By similar reasoning, the number of distinct \( 3 \times 2 \)
  sections on an \( n \times n \) board, where \( n \ge 3 \), is also
  \( (n - 1)(n - 2) \).
</p>
<p>
  Let \( h(n) \) be the total number of minimal attack sections we can
  find on an \( n \times n \) board where \( n \ge 1 \).  From the
  discussion in the previous two paragraphs, we know that \( h(n) =
  2(n - 1)(n - 2) \) for \( n \ge 3 \).  Further, this formula for \(
  h(n) \) works for \( n = 1 \) and \( n = 2 \) as well since \( h(1)
  = h(2) = 0 \) and indeed a \( 1 \times 1 \) board or a
  \( 2 \times 2 \) board is too small to contain any minimal attack
  sections.  Therefore, for all \( n \ge 1 \), we get

  \[
    h(n) = 2(n - 1)(n - 2).
  \]

  Since each minimal attack section yields two mutually attacking
  knight placements, the total number of mutually attacking knight
  placements on an \( n \times n \) board is

  \[
    f(n) = 2h(n) = 4(n - 1)(n - 2)
  \]

  for all \( n \ge 1 \).
