  Here is a puzzle I created recently for my friends who love to
  indulge in recreational mathematics:
</p>
<div class="highlight">
  Find all integer solutions to the equation

  \[
    y^2 + 3 = \frac{x^3}{18}.
  \]
</div>
<p>
  <em>If you want to think about this puzzle, this is a good time to
  pause and think about it.  There are spoilers ahead.</em>

  It does not take long to realise that this is a Diophantine equation
  of the form \( a^n + b^n = c^n.  \) Here is how the equation looks
  after rearranging the terms:

  \[
    x^3 = 18y^2 + 54.
  \]
</p>
<p>
  The right hand side is positive, so any \( x \) that satisfies this
  equation must also be positive, i.e., \( x &gt; 0 \) must hold good
  for any solution \( x \) and \( y.  \)
</p>
<p>
  Also, if some \( y \) satisfies the equation, then \( -y \) also
  satisfies the equation because the right hand side value remains the
  same for both \( y \) and \( -y.  \)
</p>
<p>
  The right hand side is \( 2(9y^2 + 3^3).  \) This is of the form \(
  2(3a^2b + b^3) \) where \( a = y \) and \( b = 3.  \) Now \( 2(3a^2b
  + b^3) = (a + b)^3 - (a - b)^3.  \) Using these details, we get

  \[
    x^3 = 18y^2 + 54 = 2(9y^2 + 3^3) = (y + 3)^3 - (y - 3)^3.
  \]

  Rearranging the terms, we get

  \[
    x^3 + (y - 3)^3 = (y + 3)^3.
  \]

  From Fermat's Last Theorem, we know that an equation of the form \(
  a^n + b^n = c^n \) does not have any solution for positive integers
  \( a, \) \( b, \) \( c, \) and positive integer \( n &gt; 2.  \) We
  know that \( x &gt; 0.  \) Therefore \( y &gt; 3 \) contradicts
  Fermat's Last Theorem.  Thus the inequality \( y \le 3 \) must hold
  good.  Further since for every solution \( x \) and \( y, \) there
  is also a solution \( x \) and \( -y, \) the inequality \( -y \le 3
  \) must also hold good.  Therefore values of \( x \) and \( y \)
  that satisfy the above equation must satisfy the following
  inequalities:

  \begin{align*}
    x &gt; 0, \\
    -3 \le y \le 3.
  \end{align*}

  Since \( y \) must be one of the seven integers between \( -3 \) and
  \( 3, \) inclusive, we can try solving for \( x \) with each of
  these seven values of \( y.  \) When we do so, we find that there
  are only two values of \( y \) for which we get integer solutions
  for \( x.  \) They are \( y = 3 \) and \( y = -3.  \) In both cases,
  we get \( x = 6.  \) Therefore, the solutions to the given equation
  are:

  \[
    x = 6, \qquad y = \pm 3.
  \]
