<!-- title: I Reinstated My Guestbook After 20 Years! -->

<p>
  I reinstated the <a href="guestbook.html">guestbook</a> on this
  website after 20 years!  As I have written in the
  <a href="about.html">About</a> page, this website began its life as
  an intranet portal in my university network back in 2001â€“2005.  When
  I left the university in 2005, the portal shut down and so did the
  guestbook.  The original website first ran on Microsoft Personal Web
  Server (PWS) and later on Microsoft Internet Information Services
  (IIS), with the guestbook data stored in a Microsoft Access
  database.
</p>
<p>
  After leaving the university, I set up this website on the World
  Wide Web and included some of the content from the original intranet
  portal.  For some reason, though, I never thought to include a
  guestbook.  And so this website went on without a guestbook for the
  next 20 years.  Finally, in June 2025, I decided to bring the
  guestbook back.  I already had a commenting system implemented for
  this website using Common Lisp and Hunchentoot, so I simply reused
  it for the guestbook.  The server program accepts POST requests to
  receive comments and writes them to text files for manual review.
  The comments are then rendered as static HTML pages by my static
  site generator.  In a way, it is less a comment system and more a
  static comments generator.
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, I could not restore all the comments from the
  original guestbook.  The Classic ASP source code of my intranet
  portal as well as the guestbook database are now lost to time.  A
  CD-ROM backup eventually succumbed to disc rot, and with it vanished
  the source code and the database.  But a handful of comments had
  survived because they had found their way into other files and
  correspondence, and I have now included them here.  It is only a
  small fraction of what once existed, but it feels good to have even
  those few fragments preserved.  The new guestbook is now available
  here:
  <a href="guestbook.html">Guestbook</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I wasn't expecting anybody to notice the new guestbook.  It is only
  mentioned in the <a href="about.html">About</a> and
  <a href="links.html">Links</a> pages, neither of which see much
  traffic.  But to my surprise, a few cheerful comments have trickled
  in.  For example, one of them said:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    I love that your website has a guestbook!  :D
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Another said:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Love the guestbook!  We need more of these.  Makes you feel
    invited.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  It's a small addition to my website, but after two decades, it feels
  good to see the guestbook alive again, and even better to see
  visitors enjoying it!
