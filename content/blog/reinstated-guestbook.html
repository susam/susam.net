<!-- title: I Reinstated My Guestbook After 20 Years! -->
<!-- tag: Web, Technology -->

<p>
  I have reinstated the <a href="guestbook.html">guestbook</a> on this
  website after 20 years!  As I have written in the
  <a href="about.html">About</a> page, this website began its life as
  an intranet portal in my university network back in 2001â€“2005.  That
  portal first ran on Microsoft Personal Web Server (PWS) and later on
  Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), with the guestbook
  data stored in a Microsoft Access database.  At the same time, I
  also maintained a small public website on the Internet, hosted on a
  subdomain provided by a free hosting service, where I published a
  subset of the articles from the intranet portal.  Both the intranet
  portal and the public website had guestbooks.  The guestbook on the
  public website was powered by a CGI script provided by the hosting
  service, which inserted each comment directly into the guestbook
  HTML page.  As some of you might guess, yes, it was vulnerable to
  cross-site scripting, but that's beside the point.
</p>
<p>
  After leaving the university, I registered my own domain name and
  set up my current website on the World Wide Web and included some of
  the content from both the original intranet portal and the old
  public website.  For some reason, though, I never thought to include
  a guestbook.  And so this website went on without a guestbook for
  the next 20 years.  Finally, in June 2025, I decided to bring the
  guestbook back.  I already had a commenting system implemented for
  this website using Common Lisp and Hunchentoot, so I simply reused
  it for the guestbook.  The
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/susam.net/blob/0.3.0/form.lisp">server program</a>
  accepts POST requests to receive comments and writes them to text
  files on the web server for manual review.  The comments are then
  rendered as static HTML pages by my static site generator.  In a
  way, it is less a comment system and more a static comment pages
  generator.

<p>
  Unfortunately, I could not restore all the comments from the
  original guestbooks.  The ASP source code of my intranet portal as
  well as the guestbook database are now lost to time.  Note that what
  I refer to as ASP here is now known as Classic ASP, to avoid
  confusion with ASP.NET.  A CD-ROM backup eventually succumbed to
  disc rot and with it vanished the source code and the database.  But
  a handful of comments had survived because they had found their way
  into other files and correspondence and I have now included them
  here.  I had better luck with the guestbook of the old public
  website, from which I was able to recover a greater number of
  comments.  It is still only a small fraction of what once existed,
  but it feels good to have even those fragments preserved.  The new
  guestbook is now available here:
  <a href="guestbook.html">Guestbook</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I wasn't expecting anybody to notice the new guestbook.  It is only
  mentioned in the <a href="about.html">About</a> and
  <a href="links.html">Links</a> pages, neither of which see much
  traffic.  Here are a few examples:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    I love that your website has a guestbook!  :D
  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Love the guestbook!  We need more of these.  Makes you feel
    invited.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  It's a small addition to my website, but after two decades, it feels
  good to see the guestbook alive again and even better to see
  visitors enjoying it!
