  Sometimes computer science, information technology, or electronics
  and communications engineering students get placed in two or three
  major Indian IT companies and they find it hard to decide which one
  to join.  <em>"Infosys, TCS, or Wipro?"</em> is one of the most
  common questions I have faced from such students.  The answer I have
  for them is much simpler than they think it is.  My answer is,
</p>
<p>
  <em>"None."</em>
</p>
<p id="what-this-post-is-not">
  Before elaborating my answer further, I should first clarify what
  this post is not.  This blog post is not about how these companies
  put food on the table for hundreds of thousands of engineers.  This
  post is not about undermining the efforts of these companies.  They
  are probably good at keeping their customers happy.  This post does
  not intend to offend the employees of these organisations although
  that is going to be hard to avoid due to the nature of this post.
</p>
<p>
  This blog post is about a choice that fresh engineering graduates
  usually have to make and the information they should have before
  they make that choice.  This post is about urging these students who
  want to make a career in engineering to avoid making a mistake that
  I did because I did not have the necessary information at the right
  time; a mistake that I corrected two years later after I realised
  it.  This blog post is about some very unpleasant facts about these
  major Indian IT companies that you wouldn't know unless you have
  been a part of it.

    Note: If you do not share the interest in pursuing excellence in
    engineering or if you find contentment in working for one of these
    three companies for reasons that are valid to you, this post may
    not resonate with you.  You may want to discontinue reading this
    post here.

  Let me now dispel the different myths that exist about these
  organisations one by one.  I am not going to mince words while I do
  this.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Training:</strong> People think that these organisations
      are good for new engineering graduates because they receive a
      lot of training which they wouldn't get in other organisations.
      I must remind such people that attending training programs does
      not necessarily amount to learning.  Indeed these organisations
      provide a lot of training but only about 1% of the trainees
      actually absorb the knowledge.  The 1% that do absorb the
      training do not stick to the organisation for a long time
      because sooner or later they realise that they want to do some
      real engineering work.  The figure "1%" is not merely a guess.
      This is my observation across various trainee-batches that have
      been trained in one of these organisations.  Think about it.
      Can you learn a new programming language in just 3 days?
      However, that is the kind of training these organisations
      provide.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Engineering:</strong> One can find engineering problems
      in these organisations but no trace of engineering.  For those
      of you who work in one of these organisations and are offended
      by this claim of mine, please revisit your engineering textbooks
      again.  Try to remind yourself what you studied then.  Consider
      what you do now.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Engineers:</strong> The number of engineers in these
      organisations are very very few; perhaps only 1 in every 200 is
      an engineer.  This is a guess, albeit not a wild one.  This is
      why there is no engineering in these companies despite the
      presence of engineering problems.  "But isn't a degree in
      engineering the minimum qualification to get a job in one of
      these organisations?", you might ask.  It is.  Yes, all of them
      have a degree in engineering but only about 1 out of 200 is an
      engineer.  The rest 199 do not understand why the bitwise
      operation <code>bitcount(not (x xor y))</code> counts the number
      of bits in <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> that match in their
      corresponding positions, why one cannot write a POSIX Basic
      Regular Expression (BRE) to match only strings with arbitrary
      number of balanced parentheses, or how to find the shortest
      chain of connections between two friends in a social network.
      Note that I have used <em>"or"</em> as the conjunction, not
      "and", in the previous sentence.  They may be good software
      users or good "software-tailors" who can create software by
      stitching together many library functions but I wouldn't call
      them engineers.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Culture:</strong> These organisations have one of the
      worst kinds of culture you can find in the whole of software
      industry.  Very few engineers are busy trying to advance their
      engineering knowledge.  Many employees use the company resources
      such as corporate blog, bulletin boards, etc. to flirt with
      their female colleagues.  Others are busy cribbing.  For those
      who have never worked for one of these organisations, it may
      come as a surprise that the corporate forums occasionally
      witness unprofessional behavior, including mud-slinging.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Onsite:</strong> Contrary to the popular belief, the
      number of trips abroad is not a measure of one's technical
      prowess.  The so-called "onsite visits" are usually driven by
      project requirements.  As a result, they often depend on luck.
      The work done during onsite visits can range from technical
      support to firefighting.  In fact, some of the smartest
      engineers I met in these organisations were reluctant to go for
      onsite trips due to the dull and stressful nature of the work
      involved.  Most of them left these organisations, joined better
      organisations where they could put their knowledge and skills to
      better use, and then moved abroad to work on good problems where
      their knowledge and technical skills were actually required.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p id="suggestion">
  Therefore, my answer to the question "Infosys, TCS, or Wipro?"  is
  "None."  That's not a very helpful answer.  Here is a more helpful
  one.  One can consider applying for a job in an organisation where
  they can get an opportunity to solve some engineering problems.  One
  cannot learn engineering and programming merely by attending
  trainings.  One has to learn it by doing, solving problems,
  observing what experienced engineers do, experimenting, screwing up
  a few times, reworking, talking to good engineers, etc.  One can try
  looking for an organisation where the leaders of projects are very
  good engineers.  Startups are more likely to have them.  Some
  matured ones are
  <a href="http://www.gluster.com/">Gluster</a>,
  <a href="http://www.parallocity.com/">Parallocity</a>,
  <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">SlideShare</a>, etc.
  New startups come up every year.  Software companies which develop
  famous and successful products are more likely to have them.  Some
  good examples are
  <a href="http://www.adobe.com/">Adobe</a>,
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>,
  <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>,
  <a href="http://www.phoenix.com/">Phoenix</a>,
  <a href="http://www.rsa.com/">RSA</a>, etc.
  How does one figure whether a certain organisation is an
  organisation of engineers?
</p>
<p>
  The clue is: <em>Interview</em>.
</p>
<p>
  Remember the technical problems they discuss in the interview.
  Think about them later.  Try discussing them with your friends who
  are known for solving good engineering problems.  An interview is
  not only an opportunity for an organisation to evaluate an
  applicant, it is also an opportunity for the applicant to evaluate
  an organisation.

    <strong>Update on 28 Oct 2011:</strong> This post got way more
    attention than I had anticipated.  It was discussed and debated
    here in the <a href="comments/infosys-tcs-or-wipro.html">comments
    section</a> as well as on
    <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2628318">Hacker News</a> and

    <strong>Update on 19 May 2021:</strong> It has been 10 years since
    this post was published.  I still occasionally get messages from
    students and professionals who are early in their career that this
    post has had a positive impact on their careers.  I am grateful
    for the positive feedback and the enduring usefulness of this
    post.

    That said, I don't actively engage in discussions about this
    particular post anymore.  I wrote this post back when I felt
    strongly about the problems in the culture I was talking about
    here.  My intention was to share my experiences and concerns,
    serving as a cautionary tale for others.  Since then, I've
    distanced myself from that culture and don't think about it
    anymore.  Further, the profession of software engineering has
    evolved a lot since then.  The widespread availability and
    utilisation of open source packages in the technology industry
    have rendered certain engineering skills, once crucial,
    considerably less relevant in the present day.  The specific
    recommendations I offered towards the end of the post may be
    outdated too.
