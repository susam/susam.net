<h2 id="approximation-problem">Approximation Problem</h2>

<p>
Everytime I travel to the US, one thing that troubles me a little is
having to convert temperature from the Celsius scale to the Fahrenheit
scale and vice versa. The exact conversion formulas are:

\begin{align*}
  f & = \frac{9c}{5} + 32, \\
  c & = \frac{5(f - 32)}{9}
\end{align*}

where \( f \) represents the temperature value in Fahrenheit and \( c \)
represents the temperature value in Celsius.
</p>

<p>
While the formulas above are accurate, they are not very convenient to
mentally figure what I need to set a room thermostat in Fahrenheit scale
to if I want to keep the room at, say, 25&nbsp;&deg;C. For this
particular case, I have memorized that 25&nbsp;&deg;C is 77&nbsp;&deg;F.
This combined with the fact that every 5&nbsp;&deg;C interval
corresponds to an interval of 9&nbsp;&deg;F, it is easy to mentally
compute that 20&nbsp;&deg;C is 68&nbsp;&deg;F or 22.5&nbsp;&deg;C is
72.5&nbsp;&deg;F. It would still be nice to find an easy way to mentally
convert any arbitrary temperature in one scale to the other scale.
</p>

<p>
In my last trip to the US, I decided to devise a few approximation
methods to convert temperature from the Fahrenheit scale to the Celsius
scale and vice versa. I arrived at two methods: one to convert
temperature value in Fahrenheit to Celsius and another to convert from
Fahrenheit to Celsius. Both these methods are based on the exact
conversion formulas but they sacrifice accuracy a little bit in favour
of simplifying the computations, so that they can be performed mentally.

<h2 id="crude-approximation-methods">Crude Approximation Methods</h2>

<p>
Before we dive into the <a href="#refined-approximation-methods">refined
approximation methods</a> I have arrived at, let us first see a very
popular method that obtains a crude approximation of the result of
temperature conversion from &deg;C to &deg;F and vice versa pretty
quickly.
</p>

<p>
To go from &deg;C to &deg;F, we perform the following two steps:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Double the value in Celsius.</li>
  <li>Add 30 to the previous result.</li>
</ol>

<p>
To go from &deg;F to &deg;C, we perform the inverse:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Subtract 30 from the value in Fahrenheit.</li>
  <li>Halve the result.</li>
</ol>

<p>
We arrive at the above methods by approximating 9/5 and 32 in the
exact conversion formulas with 2 and 30, respectively. These methods
can be performed mentally quite fast but this speed of mental
calculation comes at the cost of accuracy. That's why I call them
crude approximation methods.
</p>

<p>
The first method converts 10&nbsp;&deg;C exactly to 50&nbsp;&deg;F
without any error. But then it introduces an error of 1&nbsp;&deg;F for
every 5&nbsp;&deg;C interval. For example, the error is 3&nbsp;&deg;F
for 25&nbsp;&deg;C and 18&nbsp;&deg;F for 100&nbsp;&deg;C.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, the second method converts 50&nbsp;&deg;F exactly to
10&nbsp;&deg;C without any error. But it introduces an error of
0.5&nbsp;&deg;C for every 9&nbsp;&deg;F interval. For example, the error
is 1.5&nbsp;&deg;C for 77&nbsp;&deg;C and 9&nbsp;&deg;C for
212&nbsp;&deg;F.
</p>


<h3 id="examples-for-crude-method">Examples</h3>

<p>
Let us do a few examples to see how well the crude approximation methods
work. Let us say, we want to convert 24&nbsp;&deg;C to &deg;F.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Double 24. We get 48.</li>
  <li>Add 30 to it. We get 78.</li>
</ol>

</p>
The exact value for 24&nbsp;&deg;C is 75.2&nbsp;&deg;F. This
approximation method overestimated the actual temperature in Fahrenheit
by 2.8&nbsp;&deg;F.
</p>

<p>
Let us now convert 75&nbsp;&deg;F to &deg;C.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Subtract 30. We get 45.</li>
  <li>Divide by 2. We get 22.5.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The exact value for 75&nbsp;&deg;F is 23.89&nbsp;&deg;C. This
approximation method underestimated the actual temperature in Celsius by
1.39&nbsp&deg;C.
</p>

<p>
Can we do better?
</p>


<h2 id="refined-approximation-methods">Refined Approximation Methods</h2>

<p>
This section presents the refined approximation methods that I have
arrived at. They are a little slower to perform mentally than the
crude approximation methods but they are more accurate.
</p>

<p>
To keep the methods convenient enough to perform mentally, we work with
integers only. We always start with an integer value in Celsius or
Fahrenheit. The result of conversion is also an integer. If a fraction
arises in an intermediate step, we discard the fractional part. For
example, if a step requires us to calculate one-tenth of a number, say,
25, we consider the result to be 2. Similarly, if a step requires us to
halve the number 25, we consider the result to be 12. This is also known
as <em>truncated division</em> or <em>integer division</em> or
</p>

<p>
To go from &deg;C to &deg;F, here is my quick three-step approximation
method:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Subtract one-tenth of the value in Celsius from itself.
  </li>
  <li>
    Double the previous result.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add 31 to the previous result.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
The approximation error due to this method does not exceed 1&nbsp;&deg;F
in magnitude. In terms of Celsius, the approximation error does not
exceed 0.56&nbsp;&deg;C. I believe this is pretty good if we are talking
about setting the thermostat temperature.
</p>

<p>
To go from &deg;F to &deg;C, we roughly inverse the above steps:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Subtract 31 from the value in Fahrenheit.
  </li>
  <li>
    Halve the result.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add one-tenth of the previous result to itself.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
In fact, for integer temperature values between 32&nbsp;&deg;F
(0&nbsp;&deg;C) and 86&nbsp;&deg;F (30&nbsp;&deg;C), the approximation
error due to this method does not exceed 1.12&nbsp;&deg;C. Further, for
integer temperature values between &minus;148&nbsp;&deg;F
(&minus;100&nbsp;&deg;C) and 212&nbsp;&deg;F (100&nbsp;&deg;C), the
approximation error does not exceed 1.89&nbsp;&deg;C. This is pretty
good if we are talking about the weather.
</p>


<h3 id="examples-for-refined-method">Examples</h3>

<p>
Let us do a few examples to see how well the three-step methods above
work. Let us say, we want to convert 24&nbsp;&deg;C to &deg;F.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Subtract one-tenth of 24 from itself, i.e., subtract 2 from 24. We
    get 22.
  </li>
  <li>
    Double 22. We get 44.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add 31 to 44. We get 75.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
The exact value for 22&nbsp;&deg;C is 75.2&nbsp;&deg;F. The
approximation method has underestimated the actual temperature in
Fahrenheit by only 0.2&nbsp;&deg;F.
</p>

<p>
Let us now try to convert 75&nbsp;&deg;F to &deg;C.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Subtract 31 from 75. We get 44.
  </li>
  <li>
    Halve 44. We get 22.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add one-tenth of 22 to itself, i.e., add 2 to 22. We get 24.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
The exact value for 75&nbsp;&deg;F is 23.89&nbsp;&deg;C, so this
approximation method overestimated the actual temperature in Celsius by
0.11&nbsp;&deg;C only.
</p>

<p>
If you were looking only for quick methods to convert temperature values
in Fahrenheit to Celsius and vice versa, this is all you need to know.
You may skip the remaining post unless you want to know why these
methods work.

<h3 id="analysis">Analysis</h3>

<p>
In this section, we will see why the refined approximation methods work
so well.
</p>


<h4 id="celsius-to-fahrenheit-conversion">Celsius to Fahrenheit Conversion</h4>

<p>
The method to convert temperature value from Celsius to Fahrenheit is
equivalent to

\[
  \overset{\approx}{f} =
  2 \left(c - \left\lfloor \frac{c}{10} \right\rfloor \right) + 31
\]

where \( c \) is the temperature value in Celsius and \(
\overset{\approx}{f} \) is the approximate temperature value in
Fahrenheit.
</p>

<p>
Here is a brief justification for this:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Subtracting one-tenth (floor division by 10) of \( c \) from itself
    gives us \( c - \left\lfloor \frac{c}{10} \right\rfloor. \)
  </li>
  <li>
    Doubling the previous result gives us \( 2 \left(c - \left\lfloor
    \frac{c}{10} \right\rfloor \right). \)
  </li>
  <li>
    Adding \( 31 \) to the previous result gives us \( 2 \left(c -
    \left\lfloor \frac{c}{10} \right\rfloor \right) + 31. \)
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
Now let us see how we arrive at the above approximate conversion
formula. It's not too different from the exact conversion formula. The
exact formula to convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit is

\[
  f  = \frac{9c}{5} + 32.
\]
</p>

<p>
This can be rewritten as

\[
  f = 2 \left(c - \frac{c}{10} \right) + 32.
\]
</p>

<p>
We don't want to deal with fractions, so we decide to approximate \(
\frac{c}{10} \) in the above formula with \( \left\lfloor \frac{c}{10}
\right\rfloor \) and get

\[
  \overset{\sim}{f} =
  2 \left(c - \left\lfloor \frac{c}{10} \right\rfloor \right) + 32.
\]

where \( \overset{\sim}{f} \) is an approximation of the value in
Fahrenheit. The floor division has the effect of potentially
overestimating the final result by a value that is less than \( 2. \)
This is the approximation error.
</p>

<p>
If we define the approximation error as \( \overset{\sim}{f} - f, \)
then the approximation error lies in the half-open interval \( [0, 2). \)
To ensure that the magnitude of the error never exceeds \( 1, \) i.e.,
to make the approximation error lie in the half-open interval \( [-1,
1), \) we subtract \( 1 \) from the above formula and get

\[
  \overset{\approx}{f} =
  2 \left(c - \left\lfloor \frac{c}{10} \right\rfloor \right) + 31.
\]

This is the formula that the three-step method to convert temperature
from Celsius to Fahrenheit is equivalent to.
</p>


<h4 id="fahrenheit-to-celsius-conversion">Fahrenheit to Celsius Conversion</h4>

<p>
The inverse method to convert temperature value from Fahrenheit to
Celsius amounts to this formula:

\[
  \overset{\approx}{c} =
  \left\lfloor \frac{f - 31}{2} \right\rfloor +
  \left\lfloor \frac{f - 31}{20} \right\rfloor
\]

where \( f \) is the temperature value in Fahrenheit and
\( \overset{\approx}{c} \) is the approximate temperature value in
Celsius.
</p>

<p>
Here is a brief justification for this:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Subtracting \( 31 \) from \( f \) gives us \( f - 31. \)
  </li>
  <li>
    Halving (floor division by \( 2 \)) the previous result gives us \(
    \left\lfloor \frac{f - 31}{2} \right\rfloor. \)
  </li>
  <li>
    Adding one-tenth (floor division by \( 10 \)) of the previous result
    to itself gives us \( \left\lfloor \frac{f - 31}{2} \right\rfloor +
    \left\lfloor \frac{1}{10} \left\lfloor \frac{f - 31}{2}
    \right\rfloor \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{f - 31}{2}
    \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{f - 31}{20} \right\rfloor. \)
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
This is roughly an inverse of all the steps for converting a temperature
value from Celsius to Fahrenheit. Let us see if this is close to the
exact conversion formula

\[
  c = \frac{5(f - 32)}{9}.
\]
</p>

<p>
It turns out that it is in fact close to the exact conversion formula as
follows:

\begin{align*}
  c & =       \frac{5(f - 32)}{9} \\
    & =       0.5556 (f - 32) \\
    & \approx 0.55 (f - 31) \\
    & =       \frac{11 (f - 31)}{20} \\
    & =       \frac{f - 31}{2} + \frac{f - 31}{20} \\
    & \approx \left\lfloor \frac{f - 31}{2} \right\rfloor +
              \left\lfloor \frac{f - 31}{20} \right\rfloor
      = \overset{\approx}{c}
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>
Like we discussed earlier, the magnitude of the approximation error does
not exceed 1.89&nbsp;&deg;C for integer values between
&minus;148&nbsp;&deg;F and 212&nbsp;&deg;F. The error here is a little
bit more than the previous approximation method to convert temperature
in Celsius to Fahrenheit but it is still small enough to give us a
reasonably good estimate of what a temperature value in Fahrenheit would
look like in Celsius when we are talking about the weather.
</p>
