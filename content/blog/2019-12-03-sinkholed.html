<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>
On 26 Nov 2019 at 14:55 UTC, I logged into my server that hosts my
website to perform a simple maintenance activity. Merely three minutes
later, at 14:58 UTC, the domain name <a
href="https://susam.in/">susam.in</a> used to host this website was
transferred to another registrant without any authorization by me or
without any notification sent to me. Since the DNS results for this
domain name was cached on my system, I was unaware of this issue at that
time. It would take me three days to realize that I had lost control of
the domain name I had been using for my website for the last 12 years.
This blog post documents when this happened, how this happened, and what
it took to regain control of this domain name.

<h2 id="domain-name-transfer">Domain Name Transfer</h2>

<p>
On 29 Nov 2019 at 19:00 UTC, when I visited my website hosted at <a
href="https://susam.in">https://susam.in/</a>, I found that a zero-byte
file was being served at this URL. My website was missing. In fact, the
domain name resolved to an IPv4 address I was unfamiliar with. It did
not resolve to the address of my Linode server anymore.
</p>

<p>
I checked the WHOIS records for this domain name. To my astonishment, I
found that I was no longer the registrant of this domain. An entity
named The Verden Public Prosecutor's Office was the new registrant of
this domain. The WHOIS records showed that the domain name was
transferred to this organization on 26 Nov 2019 at 14:58 UTC, merely
three minutes after I had performed my maintenance activity on the same
day. Here is a snippet of the WHOIS records that I found:

<p>
The ellipsis denotes some records I have omitted for the sake of
brevity. There were three things that stood out in these records:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    The registrar was changed from eNom, Inc. to NIXI Special Projects.
  </li>
  <li>
    The registrant was changed from Susam Pal to The Verden Public
    Prosecutor's Office.
  </li>
  <li>
    The name servers were changed from Linode's servers to
    Shadowserver's sinkholes.
  </li>
</ol>


<h2 id="avalanche-botnet">Avalanche Botnet</h2>

<p>
On searching more about the new registrant on the web, I realized that
it was a German criminal justice body that was involved in the takedown
of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_(phishing_group)">Avalanche</a>
malware-hosting network. It took a four-year concerted effort by
INTERPOL, Europol, the Shadowserver Foundation, Eurojust, the Luneberg
Police, and several other international organizations to finally destroy
the Avalanche botnet on 30 Nov 2016. In this list of organizations, one
name caught my attention immediately: The Shadowserver Foundation. The
WHOIS name server records pointed to Shadowserver's sinkholes.
</p>

<p>
The fact that the domain name was transferred to another organization
merely three minutes after I had performed a simple maintenance activity
got me worried. Was the domain name hijacked? Did my maintenance
activity on the server have anything to do with it? What kind of attack
one might have pulled off to hijack the domain name? I checked all the
logs and there was no evidence that anyone other than me had logged into
the server or executed any commands or code on it. Further, a domain
name transfer usually involves email notification and authorization.
None of that had happened. It increasingly looked like that the three
minute interval between the maintenance activity and the domain name
transfer was merely a coincidence.
</p>

<p>
More questions sprang up as I thought about it. The Avalanche botnet was
destroyed in 2016. What has that got to do with the domain name being
transferred in 2019? Did my server somehow become part of the Avalanche
botnet? My server ran a minimal installation of the latest Debian
GNU/Linux system. It was always kept up-to-date to minimize the risk of
malware infection or security breach. It hosted a static website
composed of static HTML files served with Nginx. I found no evidence of
unauthorized access of my server while inspecting the logs. I could not
find any malware on the system.
</p>

<p>
The presence of Shadowserver sinkhole name servers in the WHOIS records
was a good clue. Sinkholing of a domain name can be done both malicously
as well as constructively. In this case, it looked like the Shadowserver
Foundation intended to sinkhole the domain name constructively, so that
any malware client trying to connect to my server nefariously would end
up connecting to a sinkhole address instead. My domain name was
sinkholed! The question now was: Why was it sinkholed?
</p>


<h2 id="support-ticket">Support Ticket</h2>

<p>
On 29 Nov 2019 at 19:29 UTC, I submitted a support ticket to Namecheap
to report this issue. At 21:05 UTC, I received a response from Namecheap
support that they have contacted Enom, their upstream registrar, to
discuss the issue. There was no estimate for when a resolution might be
available.
</p>

<p>
At 21:21 UTC, I submitted a domain name
<a href="https://forms.icann.org/en/resources/compliance/complaints/transfer/form">transfer complaint</a>
to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). I
was not expecting any response from ICANN because they do not have any
contractual authority on a country code top-level domain (ccTLD).
</p>

<p>
At 21:23 UTC, I emailed National Internet Exchange of India (NIXI). NIXI
is the ccTLD manager for .IN domain and they have authority on it. I
found their contact details from the <a
href="https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db/in.html">IANA Delegation
Record for .IN</a>. Again, I was not expecting a response from NIXI
because they do not have any contractual relationship directly with me.
They have a contractual relationship with Namecheap, so any
communication from them would be received by Namecheap and Namecheap
would have to pass that on to me.
</p>

<p>
At 21:30 UTC, ICANN responded and said that I should contact the ccTLD
manager directly. Like I explained in the previous paragraph, I had
already done that, so there was nothing more for me to do except wait
for Namecheap to provide an update after their investigation. By the
way, NIXI never replied to my email.
</p>


<h2 id="tweets-and-retweets">Tweets and Retweets</h2>

<p>
On 30 Nov 2019 at 07:30 UTC, I <a
href="https://twitter.com/susam/status/1200678538254393345">shared this
issue on Twitter</a>. I was hoping that someone who had been through a
similar experience could offer some advice. In fact, soon after I posted
the tweet, a kind person named Max from Germany generously <a
href="https://twitter.com/LTE_Max/status/1200699507631112193">offered to
help</a> by writing a letter in German addressed to the new registrant
which was a German organization. The reason for sinkholing my domain
name was still unclear. I hoped that with enough number of retweets
someone closer to the source of truth could shed some light on why and
how this happened.
</p>

<p>
At 09:54 UTC, Richard Kirkendall, founder and CEO of Namecheap, <a
href="https://twitter.com/NamecheapCEO/status/1200714718610153472">responded</a>
to my tweet and informed that they were contacting NIXI regarding the
issue. This seemed like a good step towards resolution. After all, the
domain name was no longer under their upstream registrar named Enom. The
domain name was now with NIXI as evident from the <a href="#whois">WHOIS
records</a>.
</p>

<p>
Several other users tweeted about my issue, added more information about
what might have happened, and retweeted my tweet.
</p>

<p>
On 1 Dec 2019 at 11:48 UTC, Benedict Addis from the Shadowserver
Foundation contacted me by email. He said that they had begun looking
into this issue as soon as one of the tweets about this issue had
referred to their organization. He explained in his email that my domain
name was sinkholed accidentally as part of their Avalanche operation.
Although it is now three years since the initial takedown of the botnet,
they still see over 3.5 million unique IP addresses connecting to their
sinkholes everyday. Unfortunately, their operation inadvertently flagged
my domain name as one of the domain names to be sinkholed because it
matched the pattern of command and control (C2) domain names generated
by a malware family named Nymaim, one of the malware families hosted on
Avalanche. Although, they had validity checks to avoid sinkholing
false-positives, my domain name unfortunately slipped through those
checks. Benedict mentioned that he had just raised this issue with NIXI
and requested them to return the domain name to me as soon as possible.
</p>


<h2 id="domain-name-return">Domain Name Return</h2>

<p>
On 2 Dec 2019 at 04:00 UTC, when I looked up the WHOIS records for the
domain name, I found that it had been returned to me already. At 08:37
UTC, Namecheap support responded to my support ticket to say that they
had been informed that NIXI had returned the domain name to its original
state. At 09:55 UTC, Juliya Zinovjeva, Domains Product
Manager of Namecheap, <a
href="https://twitter.com/JuliyaZinovjeva/status/1201439676118290432">commented
on Twitter</a> and confirmed the same thing.
</p>


<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>
Despite the successful resolution, it was still quite unsettling that a
domain name could be transferred to another registrant and sinkholed for
some perceived violation. I thought there would be more checks in place
to confirm that a perceived violation was real before a domain name
could be transferred. Losing a domain name I have been using actively
for 12 years was an unpleasant experience. Losing a domain name
accidentally should have been a lot harder than this. Benedict from the
Shadowserver Foundation assured me that my domain name would be excluded
from future sinkholing for this particular case. However, the
possibility that this could happen again due to another unrelated
operation by another organization in future is disconcerting.
</p>

<p>
I also wondered if a domain name under a country code top-level domain
(ccTLD) like .in is more susceptible to this kind of sinkholing than a
domain name under a generic top-level domain (gTLD) like .com. I asked
Benedict if it is worth migrating my website from .in to .com. He
replied that in his personal opinion, NIXI runs an excellent, clean
registry, and are very responsive in resolving issues when they arise.
He also added that domain generation algorithms (DGAs) of malware are
equally, and possibly more, problematic for .com domains. He advised
against migrating my website.

Thanks to everyone who retweeted my <a
href="https://twitter.com/susam/status/1200678538254393345">tweet</a> on
this issue. Also, thanks to Richard Kirkendall (CEO of Namecheap),
Namecheap support team, and Benedict Addis from the Shadowserver
Foundation for contacting NIXI to resolve this issue.

<p>
  <em><strong>Update on 06 Jan 2022:</em></strong> Nearly two years later
  after this incident, I eventually moved this website
  to <a href="https://susam.net/">susam.net</a>. The decision to do so
  was not influenced by this incident. I wanted this domain name since
  2006 but it was unavailable back then. This domain name became
  available only very recently and I moved my website to this domain
  as soon as it became available.
