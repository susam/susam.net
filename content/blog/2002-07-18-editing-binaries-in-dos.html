<!-- title: Editing Binaries in DOS -->
<!-- tag: Assembly, Programming, DOS, Technology -->
<p>
  Both MS-DOS and Windows 98 come with a debugger program
  named <code>DEBUG.EXE</code> that make it possible to edit binary
  files without requiring additional tools.  Although the primary
  purpose of this program is to test and debug executable files, it
  can be used to edit binary files too.  Two examples of this are
  shown in this post.  The first example edits a string of bytes in an
  executable file.  The second one edits machine instructions to alter
  the behaviour of the program.  Both examples provided in the next
  two sections can be reproduced on MS-DOS version 6.22.  These
  examples can be performed on Windows 98 too after minor adjustments.

<p>
  Let us first see an example of editing an error message produced by
  the <code>MODE</code> command.  This DOS command is used for
  displaying and reconfiguring system settings.  For example, the
  following command sets the display to show 40 characters per line:
</p>
<pre><samp>C:\&gt;<kbd>MODE 40</kbd></samp></pre>
<p>
  The following command reverts the display to show 80 characters per
  line:
</p>
<pre><samp>C:\&gt;<kbd>MODE 80</kbd></samp></pre>
<p>
  Here is another example of this command that shows the current
  settings for serial port COM1:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>C:\&gt;<kbd>MODE COM1</kbd>

Status for device COM1:
-----------------------
Retry=NONE

C:\&gt;</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  An invalid parameter leads to an error like this:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>C:\&gt;<kbd>MODE 0</kbd>

Invalid parameter - 0

C:\&gt;</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  We will edit this error message to be slightly more helpful.  The
  following debugger session shows how.

<p>
  We first open <code>MODE.COM</code> with the debugger.  When we do
  so, the entire program is loaded into offset 0x100 of the code
  segment (CS).  Then we use the <code>S</code> debugger command to
  search for the string "Invalid parameter".  This prints the offset
  at which this string occurs in memory.
</p>
<p>
  We use the <code>D</code> command to dump the bytes around that
  offset.  In the first row of the output, the byte value 13 (decimal
  19) represents the length of the string that follows it.  Indeed
  there are 19 bytes in the string composed of the text <code>"Invalid
  parameter"</code> and the following carriage return (CR) and line
  feed (LF) characters.  The CR and LF characters have ASCII codes 0xD
  (decimal 13) and 0xA (decimal 10).  These values can be seen at the
  third and fourth places of the second row of the output of this
  command.
</p>
<p>
  Then we use the <code>E</code> command to enter a new string length
  followed by a new string to replace the existing error message.
  Note that we enter a string length of 0x12 (decimal 18) which is
  indeed the length of the string that follows it.  After entering the
  new string, we dump the memory again with <code>D</code> to verify
  that the new string is now present in memory.
</p>
<p>
  After confirming that the edited string looks good, we use
  the <code>N</code> command to specify the name of the file we want
  to write the edited binary to.  This command starts writing the
  bytes from offset 0x100 to the named file.  It reads the number of
  bytes to be written to the file from the BX and CX registers.  These
  registers are already initialized to the length of the file when we
  load a file in the debugger.  Since we have not modified these
  registers ourselves, we don't need to set them again.  In case you
  do need to set the BX and CX registers in a different situation, the
  commands to do so are <code>R BX</code> and <code>R CX</code>,
  respectively.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, the <code>W</code> command writes the file and
  the <code>Q</code> command quits the debugger.  Now we can test the
  new program as follows:
</p>

<p>
  In this section, we will see how to edit the binary we created in
  the previous section further to add our own machine instructions to
  print a welcome message when the program starts.  Here is an example
  debugger session that shows how to do it.

<p>
  At the beginning, we use the debugger command <code>U</code> to
  unassemble (disassemble) some bytes at the top of the program to see
  what they look like.  We see that the very first instruction is a
  jump to offset 0x2298.  The debugger command <code>D 300</code>
  shows that there are contiguous zero bytes around offset 0x330.  We
  replace some of these zero bytes with new machine instructions that
  print our welcome message.  To do this, we first replace the jump
  instruction at the top with a jump instruction to offset 0x330 where
  we then place the machine code for our welcome message.  This new
  machine code prints the welcome message and then jumps to offset
  0x2298 allowing the remainder of the program to execute as usual.
</p>
<p>
  The debugger command <code>A</code> is used to assemble the machine
  code for the altered jump instruction at the top.  By default it
  writes the assembled machine code to CS:0100 which is the address at
  which DOS loads executable programs.  Then we use the debugger
  command <code>A 330</code> to add new machine code at offset 0x330.
  We try not to go beyond the region with contiguous zeroes while
  writing our machine instructions.  Fortunately for us, our entire
  code for the welcome message occupies 37 bytes and and the last byte
  of our code lands at offset 0x354.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, we write the updated program in memory back to the file
  named <code>SOUP.COM</code>.  Since the debugger was used to load
  the file named <code>SOUP.COM</code>, we do not need to use
  the <code>N</code> command to specify the name of the file again.
  When a file has just been loaded into the debugger, by default
  the <code>W</code> command writes the program in memory back to the
  same file that was loaded into the memory.
</p>
<p>
  Now our updated program should behave as shown below:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>C:\&gt;<kbd>SOUP COM1</kbd>
Welcome to Soup Kitchen!

Status for device COM1:
-----------------------
Retry=NONE

C:\><kbd>SOUP 0</kbd>
Welcome to Soup Kitchen!

No soup for you! - 0

C:\&gt;</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  That's our modified program that prints a welcome message and our
  own error message created with the humble DOS debugger.
</p>
