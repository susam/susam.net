<p>
  A field has exactly two ideals: the zero ideal, which contains only
  the additive identity, and the whole field itself.  These are known
  as trivial ideals.  Further if a commutative ring, with distinct
  additive and multiplicative identities, has no ideals other than the
  trivial ones, then it must be a field.  These two facts are elegant
  in their symmetry and simplicity.  In this article, we will explore
  why these facts are true.  Familiarity with algebraic structures
  such as groups, rings, and fields is assumed.

<h2 id="definition-of-ideals">Definition of Ideals</h2>
<p>
  A left ideal of a ring \( R \) is a subset \( I \subseteq R \) such
  that \( I \) is an additive subgroup of \( R \), and for all \( a
  \in I \) and \( r \in R \), we have \( r \cdot a \in I \).  We say
  that a left ideal absorbs multiplication from the left by any ring
  element, or equivalently, that it is closed under left
  multiplication by any ring element.
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, a right ideal of a ring \( R \) is a subset \( I
  \subseteq R \) such that \( I \) is an additive subgroup of \( R \),
  and for all \( a \in I \) and \( r \in R \), we have \( a \cdot r
  \in I \).  We say that a right ideal absorbs multiplication from the
  right by any ring element, or equivalently, that it is closed under
  right multiplication by any ring element.
</p>
<p>
  In a commutative ring \( R \), every left ideal is also a right
  ideal, and vice versa.  This is because for all \( a \in I \) and \(
  r \in R \), we have \( r \cdot a = a \cdot r \).  Therefore, when
  working with commutative rings, we do not need to distinguish
  between left and right ideals and we simply refer to them as ideals.
  In this case, the ideal is said to absorb multiplication by any ring
  element, or equivalently, it is said to be closed under
  multiplication by any ring element.

<h2 id="examples-of-ideals">Examples of Ideals</h2>
<p>
  Consider the set of even integers

  \[
    \langle 2 \rangle = \{ 2n : n \in \mathbb{Z} \}.
  \]

  This is an ideal of \( \mathbb{Z} \).  Indeed, if we multiply any
  even integer by any integer, the result is an even integer.  In
  other words, the set of even integers absorbs multiplication by any
  integer.  Equivalently, this set is closed under multiplication by
  any integer.
</p>
<p>
  Let us see another example.  Consider the ring of polynomials in the
  indeterminate \( t \) with integer coefficients, denoted \(
  \mathbb{Z}[t] \).  The set

  \[
    \langle 2, t \rangle = \{ 2f + tg : f, g \in \mathbb{Z}[t] \}
  \]

  is an ideal of \( \mathbb{Z}[t] \).  Every element of this ideal is
  a linear combination of \( 2 \) and \( t \) with polynomial
  coefficients.  If we take any element \( 2f + tg \in \langle 2, t
  \rangle \) where \( f, g \in \mathbb{Z}[t] \) and multiply it by any
  polynomial \( h \in \mathbb{Z}[t] \), we obtain \( 2fh + tgh \),
  which is again an element of \( \langle 2, t \rangle \).  Hence \(
  \langle 2, t \rangle \) absorbs multiplication by any element of \(
  \mathbb{Z}[t] \), i.e., it is closed under multiplication by
  elements of \( \mathbb{Z}[t] \).

  For the sake of brevity, we assume the following standard results.
</p>
<p id="zero-multiplication">
  <strong>Proposition 1.</strong>
  <em>
    Let \( R \) be a ring.  Then, for all \( a \in R \), we have

    \[
      a \cdot 0 = 0 \cdot a = 0.
    \]
  </em>
</p>
<p id="principal-ideal">
  <strong>Proposition 2.</strong>
  <em>
    Let \( R \) be a ring and let \( a \in R \).  Then

    \begin{align*}
      I_L &amp;= \{ r \cdot a : r \in R \}, \\
      I_R &amp;= \{ a \cdot r : r \in R \}
    \end{align*}

    are, respectively, a left ideal and a right ideal of \( R \).  If
    \( R \) is commutative, then \( I_L = I_R \), and we write

    \[
      \langle a \rangle = \{ a \cdot r : r \in R \}
    \]

    and say that \( \langle a \rangle \) is an ideal of \( R \)
    generated by \( a \).

<h2 id="ideals-of-fields">Ideals of Fields</h2>
<p>
  In this section, we show that a field \( K \) has only two ideals:
  \( \{ 0 \} \) and \( K \) itself.
</p>
<p>
  Clearly \( \{ 0 \} \) is an ideal of \( K \), as it satisfies the
  definition of an ideal.  It is the trivial additive subgroup of \( K
  \), and by <a href="#zero-multiplication">Proposition 1</a>, for all
  \( r \in K \), we have \( r \cdot 0 = 0 \in \{ 0 \} \).
</p>
<p>
  Now \( K \) is also an ideal of itself.  Since \( K \) is an additive
  group by the definition of a field, it is an additive subgroup of
  itself.  Moreover, as a field, \( K \) is closed under
  multiplication, so for all \( a, r \in K \) we have \( a \cdot r \in
  K \).
</p>
<p>
  We will now show that \( \{ 0 \} \) and \( K \) are
  the <em>only</em> ideals of \( K \).  Let \( I \) be an ideal of \(
  K \).  There are two cases to consider: \( I = \{ 0 \} \) and \( I
  \ne \{ 0 \} \).  Suppose \( I \ne \{ 0 \} \).  Then there exists a
  non-zero element \( b \in I \).  Since \( b \ne 0 \) and \( K \) is
  a field, \( b \) has a multiplicative inverse \( b^{-1} \in K \).
  Since \( b \in I \), \( b^{-1} \in K \), and \( I \) is closed under
  multiplication by any element of \( K \), we have

  \[
    1 = b \cdot b^{-1} \in I.
  \]

  Now, let \( c \in K \).  Since \( 1 \in I \), \( c \in K \), and \(
  I \) is an ideal of \( K \), we get

  \[
    c = 1 \cdot c \in I.
  \]

  Thus \( K \subseteq I \), and since \( I \subseteq K \) by
  definition, we conclude \( I = K \).  Therefore the only ideals of
  \( K \) are \( \{ 0 \} \) and \( K \) itself.
</p>
<h2 id="rings-with-trivial-ideals">Rings With Trivial Ideals</h2>
<p>
  We now show that if \( R \) is a commutative ring with \( 1 \ne 0
  \), and the only ideals of \( R \) are \( \{ 0 \} \) and \( R \)
  itself, then \( R \) must be a field.  To do this, we first show
  that every non-zero element of \( R \) has a multiplicative inverse
  in \( R \).  Let \( a \in R \) with \( a \ne 0 \).  We now show that
  there exists a multiplicative inverse \( a^{-1} \in R \).
  By <a href="#principal-ideal">Proposition 2</a>, the set

  \[
    \langle a \rangle = \{ a \cdot r : r \in R \}.
  \]

  is an ideal of \( R \).  Since \( a = a \cdot 1 \in \langle a
  \rangle \), we have \( \langle a \rangle \ne \{ 0 \} \).  By
  assumption, the only ideals of \( R \) are \( \{ 0 \} \) and \( R
  \), so it must be that \( \langle a \rangle = R \).  Therefore \( 1
  \in \langle a \rangle \) and

  \[
    1 = a \cdot s
  \]

  for some \( s \in R \).  Thus \( a \) has a multiplicative inverse
  \( s \in R \), and this holds for every non-zero \( a \in R \).
</p>
<p>
  The remaining properties of fields, namely, associativity and
  commutativity of addition and multiplication, the existence of
  distinct additive and multiplicative identities, the existence of
  additive inverses, and the distributivity of multiplication over
  addition, are inherited from the ring \( R \).  Therefore \( R \) is
  a field.
</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  To summarise, any commutative ring with distinct additive and
  multiplicative identities that has only trivial ideals is a field,
  and every field has only trivial ideals.
</p>
<p>
  Note that every field is also a commutative ring with distinct
  additive and multiplicative identities.  Therefore, we can say that
  every field is a commutative ring with distinct additive and
  multiplicative identities and only trivial ideals, and vice versa.
  It is neat how the two facts align so nicely.
