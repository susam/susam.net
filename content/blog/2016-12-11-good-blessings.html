  Back in 2009, I had completed a year working for RSA Security. I was
  then looking for more challenging work where I could work on
  projects involving mathematics and core computer science concepts
  like algorithms, parsers, compilers, etc. While I had talked to
  senior leaders of the organization about my aspirations, nothing
  concrete had materialized for several weeks. Then something
  interesting happened. One fine Monday morning, as I walked into the
  office and began to settle at my desk, the head of our research and
  development division came to my desk looking for me. He said, "Burt
  is here. He wants to talk to you."
</p>
<p>
  There was no Burt in that office as far as I knew, so I became a
  little confused. I was led into a conference room where I could meet
  him. Mildly disoriented, I opened the conference room door. Then I
  saw Burt, the person I was about to meet. As soon as I saw him, I
  immediately recognized who he was. He was Dr. Burt Kaliski, the
  Chief Scientist of RSA Laboratories. His workplace was several
  thousand miles away from mine. He had flown into our location that
  morning for meeting certain teams in our office. During his visit,
  he had carved out some time from his schedule to meet me.
</p>
<p>
  I had never met or talked to Dr. Kaliski before. But I was very well
  aware of his work and his accomplishments many years before joining
  RSA. At a previous job, while implementing digital signatures for a
  banking product, I had spent a lot of time reading the RFCs for
  <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3447">PKCS #1</a>,
  <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2898">PKCS #5</a>,
  and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2315">PKCS
  #7</a>, which were all authored by Dr. Kaliski. It was an honour to
  meet the person whose work had taught me a lot and helped me begin
  my career as a software developer in the area of information
  security.
</p>
<p>
  He began the meeting by explaining that he happened to learn about
  my wish to work on more challenging projects. He enquired about the
  type of projects I desired to work on. He listened to my thoughts
  patiently. He offered some advice and then wished me the best for my
  future. Little did I know back then that the short 30 minute
  interaction I had with him would end up changing the trajectory of
  my career.
</p>
<p>
  Soon after the meeting, I followed his advice, talked to several
  teams, found out what they were working on, and finally decided to
  join a team that worked on a network security product. It turned out
  to be the best decision of my career! While working on that product,
  I learnt to design and implement efficient algorithms for petabytes
  of data. Some parts of the project relied heavily on probability
  theory, so it was a joy to be able to take a subject that was a
  hobby until then, and apply it to solve actual real-world problems.
  Working on that product offered the intellectual challenges that my
  younger self back then yearned for. I think the most interesting
  experience there was my work on parser generators. It was so much
  fun to write algorithms in C++ that parse another formally specified
  language which in turn was used to generate in-memory FSMs to parse
  and analyze network packets and events.
</p>
<p>
  That was seven years ago. A couple of months ago, while recounting
  that 30 minute meeting with Dr. Kaliski, I could not recall if I had
  ever thanked him properly for his kindness and generosity. There was
  no compelling reason for him to meet me. I was just a regular
  software engineer who was hired into the company a year ago. We had
  never talked before. But he took the time to offer me help,
  suggestions, and advice on how I could make a great career. Unsure
  if I had expressed my gratitude to him for how he helped me sculpt
  my career, I wrote to him recently to thank him and explain how that
  one meeting had a large and positive impact on my life.
</p>
<p>
  Dr. Kaliski replied a few days later and he expressed his happiness
  to know that the steps I took in the subsequent years worked out
  well for me. Before ending his message, he wrote a little
  heart-warming note that I am going to remember forever. Quoting it
  verbatim here:
</p>
<blockquote>
  &ldquo;One of my goals is to be able to provide encouragement to
  others who are developing their careers, just as others have
  invested in mine, passing good blessings from one generation to
  another.&rdquo;

  Thank you, Burt! I will do likewise.
