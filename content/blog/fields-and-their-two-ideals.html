<p>
  A field has exactly two ideals: the zero ideal, which contains only
  the additive identity, and the whole field itself.  These are known
  as trivial ideals.  Further, if a unital commutative ring, with
  distinct additive and multiplicative identities, has no ideals other
  than the trivial ones, then it must be field.  Together, these two
  facts reveal an interesting connection between trivial ideals and
  the structure of fields. In this article, we will explore why these
  facts are true.

<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>
<p>
  A left ideal of a ring \( R \) is a subset \( I \subseteq R \) such
  that \( I \) is an additive subgroup of \( R \), and for all \( r
  \in R \) and \( x \in I \), we have \( r \cdot x \in I \).
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, a right ideal of a ring \( R \) is a subset \( I
  \subseteq R \) such that \( I \) is an additive subgroup of \( R \),
  and for all \( r \in R \) and \( x \in I \), we have \( x \cdot r
  \in I \).
</p>
<p>
  In a commutative ring \( R \), every left ideal is also a right
  ideal, and vice versa.  This is because for all \( r \in R \) and \(
  x \in I \), we have \( r \cdot x = x \cdot r \).  Therefore, when
  working with commutative rings, we do not need to distinguish
  between left and right ideals.  We simply refer to them as ideals.
  In this context, we also say that \( I \) is closed under
  multiplication by any element of the ring.
</p>
<p>
  Let us look at an example before we proceed.  The set of even integers

  \[
    \langle 2 \rangle = \{ 2n : n \in \mathbb{Z} \}
  \]

  is an ideal of \( \mathbb{Z} \) generated by the integer \( 2 \).
  Indeed, if we multiply any integer by any even integer, the result
  is an even integer.  In other words, if we multiply any element of
  \( \mathbb{Z} \) with an element of \( \langle 2 \rangle \), the
  product belongs to \( \langle 2 \rangle \).

  Familiarity with algebraic structures such as groups, rings, and
  fields is assumed.  For the sake of brevity, we also assume the
  following standard results:
</p>
<p id="zero-multiplication">
  <strong>Proposition 1.</strong>
  <em>
    Let \( R \) be a ring.  Then, for all \( a \in R \), we have

    \[
      a \cdot 0 = 0 \cdot a = 0.
    \]
  </em>
</p>
<p id="principal-ideal">
  <strong>Proposition 2.</strong>
  <em>
    Let \( R \) be a ring and let \( a \in R \).  Then

    \[
      I_L = \{ r \cdot a : r \in R \}, \quad
      I_R = \{ a \cdot r : r \in R \}
    \]

    are, respectively, a left ideal and a right ideal of \( R \).  If
    \( R \) is commutative, then \( I_L = I_R \), and we write

    \[
      \langle a \rangle = \{ r \cdot a : r \in R \}
    \]

    and say that \( \langle a \rangle \) is an ideal of \( R \)
    generated by \( a \).

<h2 id="ideals-of-fields">Ideals of Fields</h2>
<p>
  In this section, we show that a field \( K \) has only two ideals:
  \( \{ 0 \} \) and \( K \) itself.
</p>
<p>
  Clearly \( \{ 0 \} \) is an ideal of \( K \), as it satifies the
  definition of an ideal.  It is the trivial additive subgroup of \( K
  \), and by <a href="#zero-multiplication">Proposition 1</a>, for all
  \( r \in K \), we have \( r \cdot 0 = 0 \in \{ 0 \} \).
</p>
<p>
  Now \( K \) is also an ideal of itself.  This follows directly.
  Since \( K \) is an additive group by the definition of a field, it
  is an additive subgroup of itself.  Moreover, as a field, \( K \) is
  closed under multiplication, so for all \( r, x \in K \) we have \(
  r \cdot x \in K \).
</p>
<p>
  We will now show that \( \{ 0 \} \) and \( K \) are
  the <em>only</em> ideals of \( K \).  Let \( I \) be an ideal of \(
  K \).  There are two cases to consider: \( I = \{ 0 \} \) and \( I
  \ne \{ 0 \} \).  Suppose \( I \ne \{ 0 \} \).  Then there exists a
  non-zero element \( a \in I \).  Since \( a \ne 0 \) and \( K \) is
  a field, \( a \) has a multiplicative inverse \( a^{-1} \in K \).
  Since I is closed under multiplication by any element of K, we have

  \[
    a^{-1} \cdot a = 1 \in I.
  \]

  Now, let \( b \in K \).  Since \( 1 \in I \), we get

  \[
    b = b \cdot 1 \in I.
  \]

  Thus \( K \subseteq I \), and since \( I \subseteq K \) by
  definition, we conclude \( I = K \).  Therefore the only ideals of
  \( K \) are \( \{ 0 \} \) and \( K \) itself.
</p>
<h2 id="rings-with-trivial-ideals">Rings With Trivial Ideals</h2>
<p>
  We now show that if \( R \) is a unital commutative ring with \( 1
  \ne 0 \), and the only ideals \( R \) are \( \{ 0 \} \) and \( R \)
  itself, then \( R \) must be a field.  To do this, we first show
  that every non-zero element of \( R \) has a multiplicative inverse
  in \( R \).  Let \( a \in R \) with \( a \ne 0 \).  We want to show
  that the multiplicative inverse \( a^{-1} \in R \).  Consider the
  ideal

  \[
    \langle a \rangle = \{ r \cdot a : r \in R \}.
  \]

  Since \( 1 \cdot a = a \in I \), we have \( \langle a \rangle \ne \{
  0 \} \).  By assumption, the only ideals of \( R \) are \( \{ 0 \}
  \) and \( R \), so it must be that \( \langle a \rangle = R \).
  Since \( 1 \in R \), we must have

  \[
    a \cdot s = 1
  \]

  for some \( s \in R \).  Thus \( a \) has a multiplicative inverse
  \( s \in R \), and this holds for every non-zero \( a \in R \).
</p>
<p>
  The remaining properties of fields, namely, associativity and
  commutativity of addition and multiplication, the existence of
  distinct additive and multiplicative identities, the existence of
  additive inverses, and the distributivity of multiplication over
  addition, are inherited from the ring \( R \).  Therefore \( R \) is
  a field.
</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  To summarise, a field has only two ideals &ndash; the trivial ones
  &ndash; namely, \( \{ 0 \} \) and the entire field.  Moreover, any
  unital commutative ring with distinct additive and multiplicative
  identities, whose only ideals are the trivial ones, must be a field.
