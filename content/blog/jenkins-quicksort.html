<p>
  I first encountered Jenkins in 2007 while contributing to the Apache
  Nutch project.  It was called Hudson back then.  The nightly builds
  for the project ran on Hudson at that time.  I remember sifting
  through my emails and reviewing build result notifications to keep
  an eye on the patches that got merged into the trunk everyday.  Yes,
  patches and trunk!  We were still using SVN back then.
</p>
<p>
  Hudson was renamed to Jenkins in 2011.  Since version 2.0 (released
  on 20 Apr 2016), Jenkins supports pipeline scripts written in Groovy
  as a first-class entity.  A pipeline script effectively defines the
  build job.  It can define build properties, build stages, build
  steps, etc.  It can even invoke other build jobs, including itself.
</p>
<p>
  Wait a minute!  If a pipeline can invoke itself, can we, perhaps,
  solve a recursive problem with it?  Absolutely!  This is precisely
  what we are going to do in this post.  We are going to implement
  quicksort as a Jenkins pipeline for fun and not a whit of profit!

<h2 id="run-jenkins">Run Jenkins</h2>
<p>
  Before we get started, I need to tell you how to set up Jenkins just
  enough to try the experiments presented later in this post on your
  local system.  This could be useful if you have never used Jenkins
  before or if you do not have a Jenkins instance available with you
  right now.  If you are already well-versed in Jenkins and have an
  instance at your disposal, feel free to skip ahead directly to
  the <a href="#quicksort">Quicksort</a> section.
</p>
<p>
  The steps below assume a Debian GNU/Linux system.  However, it
  should be possible to do this on any operating system as long as you
  can run Docker containers.  Since software evolves over time, let me
  note down the versions of software tools I am using while writing
  this post.  Here they are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Debian GNU/Linux 12.4 (bookworm)</li>
  <li>Docker version 20.10.24+dfsg1, build 297e128</li>
  <li>Docker image tagged jenkins/jenkins:2.426.3-lts-jdk17</li>
  <li>Jenkins 2.426.3</li>
</ul>
<p>
  We will perform only quick-and-dirty experiments in this post, so we
  do not need a production-grade Jenkins instance.  We will run
  Jenkins temporarily in a container.  The following steps show how to
  do this and how to configure Jenkins for the upcoming experiments:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Install Docker if it is not already present on the system.  For
      example, on a Debian system, the following command installs
      Docker:
    </p>
    <pre><code>sudo apt-get install docker.io</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Now run the Jenkins container with this command:
    </p>
    <pre><code>sudo docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 jenkins/jenkins:lts</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      When the container starts, it prints a password towards the
      bottom of the logs.  Copy the password.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Visit <a href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080/</a>
      in a web browser.  When the <em>Unlock Jenkins</em> page
      appears, paste the password and click <em>Continue</em>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      On the <em>Customize Jenkins</em> page, click <em>Install
      suggested plugins</em>.  Alternatively, to avoid installing
      unnecessary plugins, click <em>Select plugins to install</em>,
      deselect everything except <em>Pipeline</em>, and
      click <em>Install</em>.  We need the pipeline plugin to perform
      rest of the experiment laid out in this post.
    </p>
  </li>
  <!--
    With suggested plugins:
    Completed installation of 84 plugins in 1 min 52 sec
         
    With only pipeline plugin:
    Completed installation of 50 plugins in 44 sec

      On the <em>Create First Admin User</em> page, enter the details
      to create a new user.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      On the <em>Instance Configuration</em> page, click <em>Save and
      Finish</em>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The <em>Jenkins is ready!</em> page appears.  Click <em>Start
      using Jenkins</em>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Go to <em>Build Executor Status</em> &gt; <em>Built-In Node</em>
      &gt; <em>Configure</em> and change <em>Number of executors</em>
      from the default value of <code>2</code> to <code>10</code>.
      Click <em>Save</em>.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="hello-world">Hello World</h2>
<p>
  The following steps show how to run your first Jenkins pipeline:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Go to <em>Dashboard</em> &gt; <em>New Item</em>.  Enter an item
      name, say, <code>hello</code>, select <em>Pipeline</em>, and
      click <em>OK</em>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      On the next page, scroll down to the <em>Pipeline</em> section
      at the bottom and paste the following pipeline script and
      click <em>Save</em>.
    </p>
<pre>
<code>node {
    echo "hello, world"
}</code>
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Now click <em>Build Now</em>.  A new build number appears at the
      bottom half of the left sidebar.  Click on the build number,
      then click <em>Console Output</em> to see the output of the
      pipeline.  The <code>hello, world</code> message should be
      present in the output.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  To edit the pipeline script anytime, go to <em>Dashboard</em>, click
  on the pipeline, then go to <em>Configure</em>, scroll down to
  the <em>Pipeline</em> section, edit the script, and
  click <em>Save</em>.
</p>
<p>
  In real world software development, Jenkins is typically configured
  to automatically pull some source code from a project repository
  maintained under a version control system and then build it using
  the pipeline script found in the file named <code>Jenkinsfile</code>
  present at the top-level directory of the project.  But since we
  only intend to perform fun experiments in this post, we will just
  paste our pipeline script directly into the pipeline configuration
  page on Jenkins as explained above in order to keep things simple.
  Jenkins also supports another way of writing pipelines using a
  declarative style.  They are known as <em>declarative
  pipelines</em>.  In this post, however, we will write
  only <em>scripted pipelines</em> so that we can write simple Groovy
  code for our experiments without having to bother about too many
  pipeline-specific notions like stages, steps, etc.
</p>
<h2 id="factorial">Factorial</h2>
<p>
  Now let us write a simple pipeline that calculates the factorial of
  a nonnegative integer.  This will help us to demonstrate how a build
  job can recursively call itself.  We are not going to write
  something like the following:
</p>
<pre>
<code>properties([
    parameters([
        string(
            name: 'INPUT',
            defaultValue: '0',
            description: 'A nonnegative integer'
        )
    ])
])

def factorial(n) {
    return n == 0 ? 1 : n * factorial(n - 1)
}

node {
    echo "${factorial(params.INPUT as int)}"
}</code>
</pre>
<p>
  The code above is an example of a function that calls itself
  recursively.  However, we want the <em>build job</em> (not the
  function) to call itself recursively.  So we write the following
  instead:
</p>
<pre>
<code>properties([
    parameters([
        string(
            name: 'INPUT',
            defaultValue: '0',
            description: 'A nonnegative integer'
        )
    ])
])

def MAX_INPUT = 10

node {
    echo "INPUT: ${params.INPUT}"
    currentBuild.description = "${params.INPUT} -&gt; ..."

    def n = params.INPUT as int
    if (n &gt; MAX_INPUT) {
        echo "ERROR: Input must not be greater than ${MAX_INPUT}"
    }

    env.RESULT = n == 0 ? 1 : n * (
        build(
            job: env.JOB_NAME,
            parameters: [string(name: 'INPUT', value: "${n - 1}")]
        ).getBuildVariables().RESULT as int
    )

    echo "RESULT: ${env.RESULT}"
    currentBuild.description = "${params.INPUT} -&gt; ${env.RESULT}"
}</code>
</pre>
<p>
  This code example demonstrates a few things worth noting:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      The <code>properties</code> step at the top sets up a build
      parameter named <code>INPUT</code> with a default value
      of <code>0</code>.  This will allow us to enter an input number
      while building the job.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Within the <code>node</code> block, we first check that the
      input is not too large.  If the input number is larger than 10,
      the pipeline refuses to run.  This is just a tiny safety check
      to prevent the overzealous among you from inadvertently causing
      havoc in your Jenkins instance by triggering a job with a large
      input and depleting all the executors with an excess of
      recursive jobs.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Then we perform the classic recursion to compute the factorial
      of a given nonnegative integer.  The only thing that may appear
      unusual here is that instead of just writing <code>factorial(n -
      1)</code>, we make a <code>build()</code> call to invoke the job
      itself recursively and pass <code>n - 1</code> as a build
      parameter input to that job.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Each recursively called job writes its output to an environment
      variable named <code>RESULT</code> and exits.  Then the
      higher-level job invocation looks up the environment variables
      in the build result of the job that just finished with
      the <code>getBuildVariables()</code> call, reads the
      <code>RESULT</code> variable, and multiplies the value found
      there by <code>n</code>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The lines that update <code>currentBuild.description</code> are
      there only to show handy descriptions of what is going on (the
      input and the result) in the build history that appears on the
      left sidebar.  A screenshot presented later illustrates this.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  To run the above pipeline, perform the following steps on the
  Jenkins instance:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Go to <em>Dashboard</em> &gt; <em>New Item</em>.  Enter an item
      name, say, <code>factorial</code>, select <em>Pipeline</em>, and
      click <em>OK</em>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      On the next page, scroll down to the <em>Pipeline</em> section
      at the bottom and paste the pipeline script presented above.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Click <em>Build Now</em>.  The first build sets
      the <code>INPUT</code> build parameter to <code>0</code> (the
      default value specified in the pipeline script).  The
      result <code>1</code> shoud appear in the <em>Console
      Output</em> page.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    After the first build completes, the <em>Build Now</em> option on
    the left sidebar gets replaced with the <em>Build with
    Parameters</em> option.  Click it, then enter a number,
    say, <code>5</code> and click <em>Build</em>.  Now we should see
    Jenkins recursively triggering a total of 6 build jobs and each
    build job printing the factorial of the integer it receives as
    input.  The top-level build job prints <code>120</code> as its
    result.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Here is a screenshot that shows what the build history looks like on
  the left sidebar:
</p>
<figure class="soft lightshadow">
  <img src="files/blog/jenkins-factorial.png" alt="Screenshot of Jenkins build history that shows the builds that are triggered while computing the factorial of 0 and 5">
  <figcaption>
    The factorial of 0 computed in build 1 and the factorial of 5
    computed in build 2
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  In the screenshot above, build number 2 is the build we triggered to
  compute the factorial of 5.  This build resulted in recursively
  triggering five more builds which we see as build numbers 3 to 7.
  The little input and output numbers displayed below each build
  number comes from the <code>currentBuild.description</code> value we
  set in the pipeline script.
</p>
<p>
  If we click on build number 7, we find this on the build page:
</p>

  <img src="files/blog/jenkins-recursion.png" alt="Screenshot of Jenkins build page that shows build jobs triggered recursively">
  <figcaption>
    Build #7 page
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  This was a simple pipeline that demonstrates how a build job can
  trigger itself, pass input to the triggered build and retrieve its
  output.  We did not do much error checking or error handling here.
  We have kept the code as simple as reasonably possible.  The focus
  here was only on demonstrating the recursion.
</p>
<h2 id="quicksort">Quicksort</h2>
<p>
  Now we will implement quicksort in Jenkins.  Sorting numbers using
  the standard library is quite straightforward in Groovy.  Here is an
  example in the form of Jenkins pipeline:
</p>
<pre>
<code>properties([
    parameters([
        string(
            name: 'INPUT',
            defaultValue: '4, 3, 5, 4, 5, 8, 7, 9, 1',
            description: 'Comma-separated list of integers'
        )
    ])
])

node {
    def numbers = params.INPUT.split('\\s*,\\s*').collect {it as int}
    echo "${numbers.sort()}"
}</code>
</pre>
<p>
  It can't get simpler than this.  However, we are not here to
  demonstrate the standard library methods.  We are here to
  demonstrate recursion in Jenkins!  We write the following pipeline
  script instead:
</p>
<pre>
<code>properties([
    parameters([
        string(
            name: 'INPUT',
            defaultValue: '4, 3, 5, 4, 5, 8, 7, 9, 1',
            description: 'Comma-separated list of integers'
        )
    ])
])

def MAX_INPUT_SIZE = 10

node {
    echo "INPUT: ${params.INPUT}"
    currentBuild.description = "${params.INPUT} -&gt; ..."

    def numbers = params.INPUT.split('\\s*,\\s*').collect {it as int}
    if (numbers.size() &gt; MAX_INPUT_SIZE) {
        echo "ERROR: Input must not contain more than ${MAX_INPUT_SIZE} integers"
    }

    def pivot = numbers[0]
    def others = numbers.drop(1)
    def lo = others.findAll { it <= pivot }
    def hi = others.findAll { it &gt; pivot }
    def builds = [:]
    def results = [lo: [], hi: []]

    if (lo) {
        builds.lo = {
            results.lo = build(
                job: env.JOB_NAME,
                parameters: [string(name: 'INPUT', value: lo.join(', '))
            ]).getBuildVariables().RESULT.split('\\s*,\\s*') as List
        }
    }
    if (hi) {
        builds.hi = {
            results.hi = build(
                job: env.JOB_NAME,
                parameters: [string(name: 'INPUT', value: hi.join(', '))
            ]).getBuildVariables().RESULT.split('\\s*,\\s*') as List
        }
    }
    parallel builds

    env.RESULT = (results.lo + [pivot] + results.hi).join(', ')
    echo "RESULT: ${env.RESULT}"
    currentBuild.description = "${params.INPUT} -&gt; ${env.RESULT}"
}</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Some of the code is similar to the one in the previous section.  For
  example, the <code>properties</code> step to set up the build
  parameter, the <code>build()</code> call, setting the result
  in <code>env.RESULT</code>, etc. should look familiar.  Let us pay
  attention to what is different.
</p>
<p>
  Firstly, we have two <code>build()</code> calls instead of just one.
  In fact, we have two closures with one <code>build()</code> call in
  each closure.  Then we use the <code>parallel</code> step to execute
  both these closures in parallel.  In each build job, we pick the
  first integer in the input as the pivot, then compare all the
  remaining integers with this pivot and separate them
  into <code>lo</code> (low numbers) and <code>hi</code> (high
  numbers).  Then we call the build job recursively to repeat this
  algorithm twice: once on the low numbers and again on the high
  numbers.
</p>

    Quicksort with recursive Jenkins builds
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  Unlike most textbook implementations of quicksort which lets the
  recursion run all the way to the base case in which an empty list is
  received and the recursive call returns without doing anything, the
  above implementation is slightly optimised to avoid making recursive
  builds when we find that the list of low numbers or the list of high
  numbers is empty.  We lose a little bit of simplicity by doing this
  but it helps in avoiding wasteful build jobs that just receive an
  empty list of numbers as input and exit without doing anything
  meaningful.  Further optimisation could involve avoiding recursion
  for small input sizes, such as 1 or 2, but that is not done here for
  the sake of simplicity and brevity.
</p>
<p>
  I hope this was fun!
