<h2 id="vector-spaces">Vector Spaces</h2>
<p>
A fascinating result that appears in linear algebra is the fact that the
set of real numbers \( \mathbb{R} \) is a vector space over the set of
rational numbers \( \mathbb{Q}. \) This may appear surprising at first
but it is easy to show that it is indeed so by checking that all eight
axioms of vector spaces hold good:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Commutativity of vector addition:<br>
      \( x + y = y + x \) for all \( x, y \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Associativity of vector addition:<br>
      \( x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z \) for all \( x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}.
      \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Existence of additive identity vector:<br>
      We have \( 0 \in \mathbb{R} \) such that \( x + 0 = x \) for all
      \( x \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Existence of additive inverse vectors:<br>
      There exists \( -x \in \mathbb{R} \) for every \( x \in \mathbb{R}.
      \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Associativity of scalar multiplication:<br>
      \( a(bx) = (ab)x \) for all \( a, b \in \mathbb{Q} \) and all \( x
      \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Distributivity of scalar multiplication over vector addition:<br>
      \( a(x + y) = ax + by \) for all \( a \in \mathbb{Q} \) and all \(
      x, y \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Distributivity of scalar multiplication over scalar addition:<br>
      \( (a + b)x = ax + bx \) for all \( a, b \in \mathbb{Q} \) and all
      \( x \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Existence of scalar multiplicative identity:<br>
      We have \( 1 \in \mathbb{Q} \) such that \( 1 \cdot x = x \) for
      all \( x \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

  This shows that the set of real numbers \( \mathbb{R} \) forms a
  vector space over the field of rational numbers \( \mathbb{Q}. \)
  Another quick way to arrive at this fact is to observe that \(
  \mathbb{Q} \subseteq \mathbb{R}, \) that is, \( \mathbb{Q} \) is a
  subfield of \( \mathbb{R}. \) Any field is a vector space over any
  of its subfields, so \( \mathbb{R} \) must be a vector space over \(
  \mathbb{Q}. \)
</p>
<p>
  We can also show that \( \mathbb{R} \) is an infinite dimensional
  vector space over \( \mathbb{Q}. \) Let us assume the opposite,
  i.e., \( \mathbb{R} \) is finite dimensional. Let \( r_1, \dots, r_n
  \) be the basis for this vector space. Therefore for each \( r \in
  \mathbb{R}, \) we have unique \( q_1, \dots, q_n \in \mathbb{Q} \)
  such that \( r = q_1 r_1 + \dots + q_n r_n. \) Thus there is a
  bijection between \( \mathbb{Q}^n \) and \( \mathbb{R}. \) This is a
  contradiction because \( \mathbb{Q}^n \) is countable whereas \(
  \mathbb{R} \) is uncountable. Therefore \( \mathbb{R} \) must be an
  infinite dimensional vector space over \( \mathbb{Q}. \)

<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>

<p>
Here is an interesting problem related to vector spaces that I came
across recently:
</p>

<div class="highlight">
<p>
Define two periodic functions \( f \) and \( g \) from \( \mathbb{R} \)
to \( \mathbb{R} \) such that their sum \( f + g \) is the identity
function. The axiom of choice is allowed.
</p>
<p>
A function \( f \) is periodic if there exists \( p \gt 0 \) such that
\( f(x + p) = f(x) \) for all \( x \) in the domain.
</p>
</div>

<p>

If you want to think about this problem, this is a good time to pause
and think about it. There are spoilers ahead.

</p>


<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>
The axiom of choice is equivalent to the statement that every vector
space has a basis. Since the set of real numbers \( \mathbb{R} \) is a
vector space over the set of rational numbers \( \mathbb{Q}, \) there
must be a basis \( \mathcal{H} \subseteq \mathbb{R} \) such that every
real number \( x \) can be written uniquely as a finite linear
combination of elements of \( \mathcal{H} \) with rational coefficients,
that is,
\[
  x = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{H}} x_a a
\]
where each \( x_a \in \mathbb{Q} \) and \( \{ a \in \mathcal{H} \mid x_a
\ne 0 \} \) is finite. The set \( \mathcal{H} \) is also known as the
Hamel basis.
</p>

<p>
In the above expansion of \( x, \) we use the notation \( x_a \) to
denote the rational number that appears as the coefficient of the basis
vector \( a. \) Therefore \( (x + y)_{a} = x_a + y_a \) for all \( x, y
\in \mathbb{R} \) and all \( a \in \mathcal{H}. \)
</p>

<p>
We know that \( b_a = 0 \) for distinct \( a, b \in \mathcal{H} \)
because \( a \) and \( b \) are basis vectors. Thus \( (x + b)_{a} = x_a
+ b_a = x_a + 0 = x_a \) for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \) and distinct \(
a, b \in \mathcal{H}. \) This shows that a function \( f(x) = x_a \) is
a periodic function with period \( b \) for any \( a \in \mathcal{H} \)
and any \( b \in \mathcal{H} \setminus \{ a \}. \)
</p>

<p>
Let us define two functions:
\begin{align*}
  g(x) & = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{H} \setminus \{ b \}} x_a a,
  &
  h(x) & = x_b b.
\end{align*}
where \( b \in \mathcal{H} \) and \( x \in \mathbb{R}. \) Now \( g(x) \)
is a periodic function with period \( b \) for any \( b \in \mathcal{H}
\) and \( h(x) \) is a periodic function with period \( c \) for any \(
c \in \mathcal{H} \setminus \{ b \}. \) Further,
\[
  g(x) + h(x)
  = \left( \sum_{a \in \mathcal{H} \setminus \{ b \}} x_a a \right) + x_b b
  = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{H}} x_a a
  = x.
\]
Thus \( g(x) \) and \( h(x) \) are two periodic functions such that
their sum is the identity function.
