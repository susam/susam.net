<!-- title: Reliance Jio Impersonation Issue -->
<!-- tag: technology -->
<!-- import: extra.css -->

<p>
Since yesterday (17 May 2021), I am undergoing what appears to be
someone trying to impersonate me and buy Reliance Jio mobile numbers
with my name and email address. So far 3 mobile numbers were issued by
Reliance Jio to whoever this attacker is. Here are the details of
these numbers provided below in the form of subject lines of emails I
have received:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Date: 17 May 2021 19:07<br>Subject: Order Number NO0000HD15ID
      received for Jio Number 6005758245
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Date: 18 May 2021 18:36<br>Subject: Order Number NO0000HDA7NG
      received for Jio Number 9149982331
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Date: 18 May 2021 19:07<br>Subject: Order Number NO0000HDAHZ7
      received for Jio Number 7889875316
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Now out of these three orders, two orders were cancelled eventually,
  I guess because the attacker that attempted to purchase these
  numbers with my contact details failed to produce valid
  documentation for it. Here are the email notifications I received
  for the two failed orders:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Date: 17 May 2021 19:12<br>Subject: Unable to process your
      application for Jio Number 6005758245
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Date: 18 May 2021 18:46<br>Subject: Unable to process your
      application for Jio Number 9149982331
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The reason for the failed orders was mentioned as follows in these
  emails:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Due to incomplete or mismatched information, your application for
  Jio Number [number] could not be processed.
</blockquote>

<p>
  But Reliance Jio has activated the third number!
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Date: 18 May 2021 17:28 PM<br>Subject: Your Jio Number 7889875316
      has been activated
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Here is a summary of all the order details:

  See the fourth row which is an order still in progress where the
  attacker is using the mobile number from the third row which
  Reliance Jio has activated for some reason.
</p>

<p>
There are a few things to note here:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If it were only a single email notification like this, I could
    entertain the thought that this could be a genuine customer who
    mistyped the email address and entered mine by mistake. But 3
    notifications, one activated mobile number, and one more in
    progress, I am now worried that this is an active attack going on!
  </li>
  <li>
    There was no email verification whatsoever to confirm whether the
    person making the purchase (who I think is an attacker) really
    owns the email address they entered while making the purchase.
    Apparently, Reliance Jio allows anyone to purchase a new mobile
    number with anyone's email address without verifying whether the
    customer really owns the given email address by sending a link or
    OTP to the email address. This appears to be a bug in their
    registration workflow. I have reported this bug to them via their
    bug reporting email address (jio.bugsreporting at jio.com).
  </li>
  <li>
    One might wonder if these are merely spam or phishing emails. I
    have confirmed that they are not. I have contacted the Reliance
    Customer Support team about it and while they acknowledge the
    problem, they are not making any progress in providing a
    resolution. They just keep asking me to call 1800-88-99999 but
    that is of no help to me because the first thing you need to do
    after calling that number is punch in your Jio number. Well, I
    don't have any Jio number and that is the whole issue here, is it
    not? I don't have any Jio mobile number. Someone else is buying
    Jio mobile numbers with my contact details. The customer support
    workflow appears to be totally dysfunctional for an issue of this
    nature.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Trying to get the attention of the Appellate Authority at the Jio
  Jammu and Kashmir office as well as Jio Bangalore office has yielded
  no results yet. If you know how I can have this issue resolved, I
  would appreciate the help! You are welcome to email me directly to
  susam.pal at gmail.com or talk to me
