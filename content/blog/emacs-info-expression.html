  On <code>#emacs</code> IRC or Matrix channels, we often share
  references to the built-in Emacs documentation as Elisp expressions
  that look like this:
</p>
<pre><code>(info "(emacs) Basic Undo")</code></pre>
<p>
  Here is another example:
</p>
<pre><code>(info "(emacs) Word Search")</code></pre>
<p>
  This is a common practice in the Emacs channels even though all of
  the Emacs manual is available on the World Wide Web too.  For
  example, the section referred to above expression is available here:
  <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Word-Search.html">GNU
  Emacs Manual: Word Search</a>.  The reason for sharing Elisp
  expressions like this is likely partly tradition and partly
  convenience.  Many Emacs users are logged into IRC networks via
  Emacs itself, so once the recipient sees an Elisp expression like
  the above one in their chat buffer, visiting the corresponding
  manual page is a simple matter of placing the cursor right after the
  closing parenthesis and typing <code>C-x C-e</code>.
</p>
<p>
  But isn't it clumsy for the sender to type Elisp expressions like
  this merely to share a pointer to a section of a manual with others?
  Turns out, it is not.  This is Emacs!  So of course there are
  key-bindings to do this.
</p>
<p>
  Say, while helping another Emacs user we type <code>M-x info-apropos
  RET version control RET</code> and land on the section "Branches"
  and realise that this is the section that the person we are trying
  to help should read.  Now when we are on this section, we can simply
  type <code>c</code> and Emacs will copy the name of the current Info
  node to the kill ring.  The name looks like this:
</p>
<pre><code>(emacs) Branches</code></pre>
<p>
  While this is handy in some situations, it isn't the
  <code>info</code> expression we want.  It's just the Info node name.
  To copy the complete <code>info</code> expression with the node
  name, we need to use the zero prefix argument with
  the <code>c</code> key.  So when we are on the section "Branches",
  if we type <code>C-0 c</code>, the following expression is copied to
  the kill ring:
</p>
<pre><code>(info "(emacs) Branches")</code></pre>
<p>
  The person who receives this <code>info</code> expression can visit
  the corresponding section of the manual simply by evaluating it.
  For example, after copying the expression in Emacs, they could
  type <code>C-y C-x C-e</code> to paste the expression into a buffer
  and evaluate it immediately.  Alternatively, they might want to
  type <code>M-: C-y RET</code> to bring the
  <code>eval-expression</code> minibuffer, paste the expression there
  and evaluate it.
