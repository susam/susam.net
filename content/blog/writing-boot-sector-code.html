<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>
  In this article, we discuss how to write our own
  <code>"hello, world"</code> program into the boot sector.  At the
  time of this writing, most such code examples available on the web
  were meant for the Netwide Assembler (NASM).  Very little material
  was available that could be tried with the readily available GNU
  tools like the GNU assembler (as) and the GNU linker (ld).  This
  article is an effort to fill this gap.
</p>
<h2 id="boot-sector">Boot Sector</h2>
<p>
  When the computer starts, the processor starts executing
  instructions at the memory address 0xffff:0x0000 (CS:IP).  This is
  an address in the BIOS ROM.  The machine instructions at this
  address begins the boot sequence.  In practice, this memory address
  contains a <code>JMP</code> instruction to another address,
  typically 0xf000:0xe05b.  This latter address contains the code to
  perform power-on self test (POST), perform several initialisations,
  find the boot device, load the code from the boot sector into
  memory, and execute it.  From here, the code in the boot sector
  takes control.  In IBM-compatible PCs, the boot sector is the first
  sector of a data storage device.  This is 512 bytes in length.  The
  following table shows what the boot sector contains.

  This type of boot sector found in IBM-compatible PCs is also known
  as master boot record (MBR).  The next two sections explain how to
  write executable code into the boot sector.  Two programs are
  discussed in the these two sections: one that merely prints a
  character and another that prints a string.
</p>
<p>
  The reader is expected to have a working knowledge of x86 assembly
  language programming using GNU assembler.  The details of assembly
  language won't be discussed here.  Only how to write code for boot
  sector will be discussed.
</p>
<p>
  The code examples were verified by using the following tools while
  writing this article:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 (etch)</li>
  <li>GNU assembler (GNU Binutils for Debian) 2.17</li>
  <li>GNU ld (GNU Binutils for Debian) 2.17</li>
  <li>dd (coreutils) 5.97</li>
  <li>DOSBox 0.65</li>
  <li>QEMU 0.8.2</li>

<p>
  The following code prints the character 'A' in yellow on a blue
  background:
</p>
<pre>
<code>.code16
.section .text
.globl _start
_start:
  mov $0xb800, %ax
  mov %ax, %ds
  mov $0x1e41, %ax
  xor %di, %di
  mov %ax, (%di)
idle:
  hlt
  jmp idle</code>
</pre>
<p>
  We save the above code in a file, say <code>a.s</code>, then
  assemble and link this code with the following commands:
</p>
<pre>
<code>as -o a.o a.s
ld --oformat binary -o a.com a.o</code>
</pre>
<p>
  The above commands should generate a 15-byte output file
  named <code>a.com</code>.  The <code>.code16</code> directive in the
  source code tells the assembler that this code is meant for 16-bit
  mode.  The <code>_start</code> label is meant to tell the linker
  that this is the entry point in the program.
</p>
<p>
  The video memory of the VGA is mapped to various segments between
  0xa000 and 0xc000 in the main memory.  The colour text mode is
  mapped to the segment 0xb800.  The first two instructions copy
  0xb800 into the data segment register, so that any data offsets
  specified is an offset in this segment.  Then the ASCII code for the
  character 'A' (i.e., 0x41 or 65) is copied into the first location
  in this segment and the attribute (0x1e) of this character to the
  second location.  The higher nibble (0x1) is the attribute for
  background colour and the lower nibble (0xe) is that of the
  foreground colour.  The highest bit of each nibble is the
  intensifier bit.  Depending on the video mode setup, the highest bit
  may also represent a blinking character.  The other three bits
  represent red, green, and blue.  This is represented in a tabular
  form below.

  We can be see from the table that the background colour is dark blue
  and the foreground colour is bright yellow.  We assemble and link
  the code with the <code>as</code> and <code>ld</code> commands
  mentioned earlier and generate an executable binary consisting of
  machine code.
</p>
<p>
  Before writing the executable binary into the boot sector, we might
  want to verify whether the code works correctly with an emulator.
  DOSBox is a pretty good emulator for this purpose.  It is available
  as the <code>dosbox</code> package in Debian.  Here is one way to
  run the executable binary file using DOSBox:
</p>
<pre><code>dosbox -c cls a.com</code></pre>
<p>
  The letter <code>A</code> printed in yellow on a blue foreground
  should appear in the first column of the first row of the screen.
</p>
<p>
  In the <code>ld</code> command earlier to generate the executable
  binary, we used the extension name <code>com</code> for the binary
  file to make DOSBox believe that it is a DOS COM file, i.e., merely
  machine code and data with no headers.  In fact, the <code>--oformat
  binary</code> option in the <code>ld</code> command ensures that the
  output file contains only machine code.  This is why we are able to
  run the binary with DOSBox for verification.  If we do not use
  DOSBox, any extension name or no extension name for the binary would
  suffice.
</p>
<p>
  Once we are satisfied with the output of <code>a.com</code> running
  in DOSBox, we create a boot image file with this command: sector
  with these commands:
</p>
<pre>
<code>cp a.com a.img
echo 55 aa | xxd -r -p | dd seek=510 bs=1 of=hello.img</code>
</pre>
<p>
  This boot image can be tested with DOSBox using the following
  command:
</p>
<pre><code>dosbox -c cls -c 'boot a.img'</code></pre>
<p>
  Yet another way to test this image would be to make QEMU x86 system
  emulator boot using this image.  Here is the command to do so:
</p>
<pre><code>qemu-system-i386 -fda a.img</code></pre>
<p>
  Finally, if you are feeling brave enough, you could write this image
  to the boot sector of an actual physical storage device, such as a
  USB flash drive, and then boot your computer with it.  To do so, you
  first need to determine the device file that represents the storage
  device.  There are many ways to do this.  A couple of commands that
  may be helpful to locate the storage device are <code>mount</code>
  and <code>fdisk -l</code>.  Assuming that there is a USB flash drive
  at <code>/dev/sdx</code>, the boot image can be written to its boot
  sector using this command:
</p>
<pre><code>cp a.img /dev/sdx</code></pre>
<p>
  <em>
    CAUTION: You need to be absolutely sure of the device path of the
    device being written to.  The device path <code>/dev/sdx</code> is
    only an example here.  If the boot image is written to the wrong
    device, access to the data on that would be lost.
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  Now booting the computer with this device should show display the
  letter 'A' in yellow on a blue background.
</p>
<h2 id="print-string">Print String</h2>
<p>
  The following code prints the string "hello, world" in yellow on a
  blue background:
</p>
<pre>
<code>.code16

.section .text
.globl _start
_start:
  ljmp $0, $start
start:
  mov $0xb800, %ax
  mov %ax, %ds
  xor %di, %di
  mov $message, %si
  mov $0x1e, %ah
print:
  mov %cs:(%si), %al
  mov %ax, (%di)
  inc %si
  inc %di
  inc %di
  cmp $24, %di
  jne print
idle:
  hlt
  jmp idle

.section .data
message:
  .ascii "hello, world"</code>
</pre>
<p>
  The BIOS reads the code from the first sector of the boot device
  into the memory at physical address 0x7c00 and jumps to that
  address.  While most BIOS implementations jump to 0x0000:0x7c00
  (CS:IP) to execute the boot sector code loaded at this address,
  unfortunately there are some BIOS implementations that jump to
  0x07c0:0x0000 instead to reach this address.  We will soon see that
  we are going to use offsets relative to the code segment to locate
  our string and copy it to video memory.  While the physical address
  of the string is always going to be the same regardless of which of
  the two types of BIOS implementations run our program, the offset of
  the string is going to differ based on the BIOS implementation.  If
  the register CS is set to 0 and the register IP is set to 0x7c00
  when the BIOS jumps to our program, the offset of the string is
  going to be greater than 0x7c00.  But if CS and IP are set to 0x07c0
  and 0, respectively, when the BIOS jumps to our program, the offset
  of the string is going to be much smaller.
</p>
<p>
  We cannot know in advance which type of BIOS implementation is going
  to load our program into memory, so we need to prepare our program
  to handle both scenarios: one in which the BIOS executes our program
  by jumping to 0x0000:0x7c00 as well as the other in which the BIOS
  jumps to 0x07c0:0x0000 to execute our program.  We do this by using
  a very popular technique of setting the register CS to 0 ourselves
  by executing a far jump instruction to the code segment 0.  The very
  first instruction in this program that performs <code>ljmp $0,
  $start</code> accomplishes this.
</p>
<p>
  There are two sections in this code.  The text section has the
  executable instructions.  The data section has the string we want to
  print.  The code copies the first byte of the string to the memory
  location 0xb800:0x0000, its attribute to 0xb800:0x0001, the second
  byte of the string to 0xb800:0x0002, its attribute to 0xb800:0x0003
  and so on until it has advanced to 0xb800:0x0018 after having
  written 24 bytes for the 12 characters we need to print.  The
  instruction <code>movb %cs:(%si), %al</code> copies one character
  from the string indexed by the SI register in the code segment into
  the AL register.  We are reading the characters from the code
  segment because we will place the string in the code segment using
  the linker commands discussed later.
</p>
<p>
  However, while testing with DOSBox, things are a little different.
  In DOS, the text section is loaded at an offset 0x0100 in the code
  segment.  This should be specified to the linker while linking so
  that it can correctly resolve the value of the label
  named <code>message</code>.  Therefore we will assemble and link our
  program twice: once for testing it with DOSBox and once again for
  creating the boot image.
</p>
<p>
  To understand the offset at which the data section can be put, it is
  worth looking at how the binary code looks like with a trial linking
  with the following commands:
</p>
<pre>
<code>as -o hello.o hello.s
ld --oformat binary -Ttext 0 -Tdata 40 -o hello.com hello.o
objdump -bbinary -mi8086 -D hello.com
xxd -g1 hello.com</code>
</pre>
<p>
  The <code>-Ttext 0</code> option tells the linker to assume that the
  text section should be loaded at offset 0x0 in the code segment.
  Similarly, the <code>-Tdata 40</code> tells the linker to assume
  that the data section is at offset 0x40.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>objdump</code> command mentioned above disassembles the
  generated binary file.  This shows where the text section and data
  section are placed.
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>objdump -bbinary -mi8086 -D hello.com</kbd>

</pre>
<p>
  Note that the <samp>...</samp> above indicates zero bytes skipped
  by <code>objdump</code>.  The text section is above these zero bytes
  and the data section is below them.  Let us also see the output of
  the <code>xxd</code> command:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>xxd -g1 hello.com</kbd>
00000000: ea 05 00 00 00 b8 00 b8 8e d8 31 ff be 40 00 b4  ..........1..@..

00000040: 68 65 6c 6c 6f 2c 20 77 6f 72 6c 64              hello, world</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  Both outputs above show that the text section occupies the first
  0x21 bytes (33 bytes).  The data section is 0xc bytes (12 bytes) in
  length.  Let us create a binary where the region from offset 0x0 to
  offset 0x20 contains the text section and the region from offset
  0x21 to offset 0x2c contains the data section.  The total length of
  the binary would then be 0x2d bytes (45 bytes).  We will create a
  new binary as per this plan.
</p>
<p>
  However while creating the new binary, we should remember that DOS
  would load the binary at offset 0x100, so we need to tell the linker
  to assume 0x100 as the offset of the text section and 0x121 as the
  offset of the data section, so that it resolves the value of the
  label named <code>message</code> accordingly.  Moreover while
  testing with DOS, we must remove the far jump instruction at the top
  of our program because DOS does not load our program at physical
  address 0x7c00 of the memory.  We create a new binary in this manner
  and test it with DOSBox with these commands:
</p>
<pre>
<code>grep -v ljmp hello.s &gt; dos-hello.s
as -o hello.o dos-hello.s
ld --oformat binary -Ttext 100 -Tdata 121 -o hello.com hello.o</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Now we can test this program with DOSBox with the following command:
</p>
<pre><code>dosbox -c cls hello.com</code></pre>
<p>
  If everything looks fine, we assemble and link our program once
  again for boot sector and create a boot image with these commands:
</p>
<pre>
<code>as -o hello.o hello.s
ld --oformat binary -Ttext 7c00 -Tdata 7c21 -o hello.img hello.o
echo 55 aa | xxd -r -p | dd seek=510 bs=1 of=hello.img</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Now we can test this image with DOSBox like this:
</p>
<pre><code>dosbox -c cls -c 'boot hello.img'</code></pre>
<p>
  We can also test the image with QEMU with the following command:
</p>
<pre><code>qemu-system-i386 -fda hello.img</code></pre>
<p>
  Finally, this image can be written to the boot sector as follows:
</p>
<pre><code>cp hello.img /dev/sdx</code></pre>
<p>
  <em>
    CAUTION: Again, one needs to be very careful with the commands
    here.  The device path <code>/dev/sdx</code> is only an example.
    This path must be changed to the path of the actual device one
    wants to write the boot sector binary to.
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  Once written to the device successfully, the computer may be booted
  with this device to display the "hello, world" string on the screen.
</p>
