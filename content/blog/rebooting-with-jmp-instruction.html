<p>
  While learning about x86 microprocessors, I realised that it is
  possible to reboot a computer running MS-DOS or Windows 98 by
  jumping to the memory address FFFF:0000.  Here is an
  example <code>DEBUG.EXE</code> session from MS-DOS 6.22:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>C:\&gt;<kbd>DEBUG</kbd>
<kbd>G =FFFF:0000</kbd></samp>
</pre>
<p>
  In the above example, we start the DOS debugger and then enter
  the <code>G</code> (go) command to execute the program at FFFF:0000.
  Just doing this simple operation should reboot the system
  immediately.
</p>
<p>
  When the computer boots, the x86 microprocessor starts in real mode
  and executes the instruction at FFFF:0000.  This is an address in
  the BIOS ROM that contains a far jump instruction to go to another
  address, typically F000:E05B.
</p>
<pre>
<samp>C:\&gt;<kbd>DEBUG</kbd>
-<kbd>U FFFF:0000 4</kbd>
FFFF:0000 EA5BE000F0    JMP     F000:E05B</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  The address F000:E05B contains the BIOS start-up program which
  performs a power-on self-test (POST), initialises the peripheral
  devices, loads the boot sector code, and executes it.  These
  operations complete the booting sequence.
</p>
<p>
  The important point worth noting here is that the very first
  instruction the microprocessor executes after booting is the
  instruction at FFFF:0000.  We can use this fact to create a tiny
  executable program that can be used to reboot the computer.  Of
  course, we can always perform a soft reboot using the key
  sequence <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>del</kbd>.  However,
  just for fun, let us create a program to reboot the computer with
  a <code>JMP FFFF:0000</code> instruction.

<h2 id="reboot-program">Reboot Program</h2>
<p>
  Here is a complete <code>DEBUG.EXE</code> session that shows how we
  could write a simple reboot program:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>C:\&gt;<kbd>DEBUG</kbd>
-<kbd>A</kbd>
1165:0100 <kbd>JMP FFFF:0000</kbd>
1165:0105
-<kbd>N REBOOT.COM</kbd>
-<kbd>R CX</kbd>
CX 0000
:<kbd>5</kbd>
-<kbd>W</kbd>
Writing 00005 bytes
-<kbd>Q</kbd>

C:\&gt;</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  Note that the <code>N</code> (name) command specifies the name of
  the file where we write the binary machine code to.  Also, note that
  the <code>W</code> (write) command expects the registers BX and CX
  to contain the number of bytes to be written to the file.  When the
  DOS debugger starts, it already initialises BX to 0 automatically,
  so we only set the register CX to 5 with the <code>R CX</code>
  command above.
</p>
<p>
  Now we can execute this 5-byte program like this:
</p>
<pre><samp>C:&gt;<kbd>REBOOT</kbd></samp></pre>
<h2 id="debugger-scripting">Debugger Scripting</h2>
<p>
  In the previous section, we saw how we can start
  <code>DEBUG.EXE</code> and type the debugger commands and the
  assembly language instruction to jump to FFFF:0000.  We can also keep
  these debugger inputs in a separate text file and feed that to the
  debugger.  Here is how the content of such a text file would look:
</p>
<pre>
<code>A
JMP FFFF:0000

N REBOOT.COM
R CX
5
W
Q</code>
</pre>
<p>
  If the above input is saved in a file, say, <code>REBOOT.TXT</code>,
  then we can run the DOS command <code>DEBUG &lt; REBOOT.TXT</code>
  to assemble the program and create the binary executable file.  The
  following DOS session example shows how this command behaves:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>C:\&gt;<kbd>DEBUG &lt; REBOOT.TXT</kbd>
-A
1165:0100 JMP FFFF:0000
1165:0105
-N REBOOT.COM
-R CX
CX 0000
:5
-W
Writing 00005 bytes
-Q

C:&gt;</samp>
</pre>
<h2 id="disassembly">Disassembly</h2>
<p>
  Here is a quick demonstration of how we can disassemble the
  executable code:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>C:\&gt;<kbd>DEBUG REBOOT.COM</kbd>
-<kbd>U 100 104</kbd>
117C:0100 EA0000FFFF    JMP     FFFF:0000</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  While we did not really need to disassemble this tiny program, the
  above example shows how we can use the debugger
  command <code>U</code> (unassemble) to translate machine code to
  assembly language mnemonics.
