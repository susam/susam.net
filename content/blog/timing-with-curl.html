<p>
  Here is a command I use often while measuring why an HTTP request is
  taking too long:
</p>
<pre>
<code>curl -L -w "time_namelookup: %{time_namelookup}
time_connect: %{time_connect}
time_appconnect: %{time_appconnect}
time_pretransfer: %{time_pretransfer}
time_redirect: %{time_redirect}
time_starttransfer: %{time_starttransfer}
time_total: %{time_total}
" https://example.com/</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Here is the same command written as a one-liner, so that I can copy
  it easily from this page with a triple-click whenever I need it in
  future:
</p>
<pre><code>curl -L -w "time_namelookup: %{time_namelookup}\ntime_connect: %{time_connect}\ntime_appconnect: %{time_appconnect}\ntime_pretransfer: %{time_pretransfer}\ntime_redirect: %{time_redirect}\ntime_starttransfer: %{time_starttransfer}\ntime_total: %{time_total}\n" https://example.com/</code></pre>
<p>
  Here is how the output of the above command typically looks:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>curl -L -w "namelookup: %{time_namelookup}\nconnect: %{time_connect}\nappconnect: %{time_appconnect}\npretransfer: %{time_pretransfer}\nstarttransfer: %{time_starttransfer}\ntotal: %{time_total}\n" https://example.com/</kbd>

time_namelookup: 0.001403
time_connect: 0.245464

</pre>
<p>
  In the output above, I have omitted most of the HTML output and
  replaced the omitted part with ellipsis for the sake of brevity.
</p>
<p>
  The list below provides a description of each number in the output
  above.  This information is picked straight from the manual page of
  curl 7.20.0.  Here are the details:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em>time_namelookup:</em> The time, in seconds, it took from the
      start until the name resolving was completed.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em>time_connect:</em> The time, in seconds, it took from the
      start until the TCP connect to the remote host (or proxy) was
      completed.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em>time_appconnect:</em> The time, in seconds, it took from the
      start until the SSL/SSH/etc connect/handshake to the remote host
      was completed.  (Added in 7.19.0)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em>time_pretransfer:</em> The time, in seconds, it took from
      the start until the file transfer was just about to begin.  This
      includes all pre-transfer commands and negotiations that are
      specific to the particular protocol(s) involved.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em>time_redirect:</em> The time, in seconds, it took for all
      redirection steps include name lookup, connect, pretransfer and
      transfer before the final transaction was started.
      time_redirect shows the complete execution time for multiple
      redirections.  (Added in 7.12.3)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em>time_starttransfer:</em> The time, in seconds, it took from
      the start until the first byte was just about to be transferred.
      This includes time_pretransfer and also the time the server
      needed to calculate the result.
    </p>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em>time_total:</em> The total time, in seconds, that the full
      operation lasted.  The time will be displayed with millisecond
      resolution.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  An important thing worth noting here is that the difference in the
  numbers for <code>time_appconnect</code>
  and <code>time_connect</code> time tells us how much time is spent
  in SSL/TLS handshake.  For a cleartext connection without SSL/TLS,
  <code>time_appconnect</code> is reported as zero.  Here is an example
  output that demonstrates this:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>curl -L -w "time_namelookup: %{time_namelookup}\ntime_connect: %{time_connect}\ntime_appconnect: %{time_appconnect}\ntime_pretransfer: %{time_pretransfer}\ntime_redirect: %{time_redirect}\ntime_starttransfer: %{time_starttransfer}\ntime_total: %{time_total}\n" http://example.com/</kbd>
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
...
&lt;/html&gt;
time_namelookup: 0.001507
time_connect: 0.247032
time_appconnect: 0.000000
time_pretransfer: 0.247122
time_redirect: 0.000000
time_starttransfer: 0.512645
time_total: 0.512853</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  Also note that <code>time_redirect</code> is zero in both outputs
  above.  That is because no redirection occurs while visiting
  <a href="https://example.com">example.com</a>.  Here is another
  example that shows how the output looks when a redirection occurs:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>curl -L -w "time_namelookup: %{time_namelookup}\ntime_connect: %{time_connect}\ntime_appconnect: %{time_appconnect}\ntime_pretransfer: %{time_pretransfer}\ntime_redirect: %{time_redirect}\ntime_starttransfer: %{time_starttransfer}\ntime_total: %{time_total}\n" https://susam.net/blog</kbd>
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
...
&lt;/html&gt;
time_namelookup: 0.001886
time_connect: 0.152445
time_appconnect: 0.465326
time_pretransfer: 0.465413
time_redirect: 0.614289
time_starttransfer: 0.763997
time_total: 0.765413</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  When faced with a potential latency issue in web services, this is
  often one of the first commands I run several times from multiple
  clients because the results from this command help to get a quick
  sense of the layer that might be responsible for the latency issue.
