  I often read PDF documents in Firefox, and sometimes I prefer to
  work in dark mode, especially at night when the room lights are
  dimmed.  However, the bright white background of the Firefox PDF
  viewer can be glaring and uncomfortable when dark mode is enabled.
  Additionally, writing a userscript to invert the background and text
  colours in the PDF viewer does not work.  I have confirmed with
  Firefox version 137.0 that userscripts do not run within the PDF
  viewer.
</p>
<p>
  For example, consider this simple userscript that just prints a
  "hello" message when a web page loads:
  <a href="code/lab/userscript/hello.js">hello.js</a>.  This script
  works on regular web pages but does not execute when viewing a PDF
  file in Firefox.
  See <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1454760">Bug
  1454760</a> for more details about this restriction.
</p>
<p>
  While userscripts are often my go-to solution for customisations
  like this, for this particular problem, I resorted to writing a tiny
  bookmarklet to work around the above limitation.  Here is the
  bookmarklet:
</p>
<pre><code>javascript:(()=&gt;{['thumbnailView','viewer'].map(id=&gt;document.getElementById(id).style.filter='invert(0.9)saturate(0)')})()</code></pre>
<p>
  To add this to Firefox, from the Firefox menu, select "Bookmarks".
  Then in the left sidebar, right click on either "Bookmarks Toolbar"
  or "Bookmarks Menu", depending on where you want to add the
  bookmarklet, and select "Add Bookmark".  Enter some name in the
  "Name" field and then in the "URL" field, enter the above line of
  code.  Click "Save" and you are done.  The next time you open a PDF
  file in Firefox, find the bookmark in the bookmarks menu or toolbar,
  click on it, and it should instantly invert the colour scheme of the
  PDF viewer.
</p>
<p>
  Alternatively, simply drag the following link and drop it onto your
  Firefox toolbar:
</p>
<p class="textcenter">
  <a href="javascript:(()=%3e%7b%5b'thumbnailView','viewer'%5d.map(id=%3edocument.getElementById(id).style.filter='invert(0.9)saturate(0)')%7d)()">Dim PDF</a>
</p>
<p>
  While the default PDF viewer of Firefox does not support
  userscripts, this bookmarklet is a simple, effective way to give
  PDFs a darker look.  If you're like me and often read books and
  papers in PDF format at night, you might find this handy.
