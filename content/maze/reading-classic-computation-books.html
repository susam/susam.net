<p>
  Hello readers and learners!  In the last few months, some of us from
  mathematics and algorithms communities of IRC networks have come
  together to form a tiny group that meets a few times every week and
  reads a book together.  The focus of this loosely formed group is on
  picking reading material about concepts and technologies that have
  been around for a long time and have an air of timelessness around
  them.
</p>
<p>
  In particular, we will not be chasing the latest trends in
  technology most of the time.  But this is not a retrocomputing
  community either.  For example, we are likely not going to talk
  about BASIC programming on Commodore 64.  The topics we pick for our
  discussions are largely going to be topics that are still quite
  relevant and important in the field of mathematics and computation
  but they may not be what is considered to be mainstream.  For
  example, we will read books like <em>Introduction to Analytic Number
  Theory</em> or talk about Common Lisp programming.  Sometimes these
  topics may intersect with modern trends or retrocomputing but most
  of the times they would not.  That is the kind of sweet spot we want
  to hit.
</p>
<h2 id="past">Origin</h2>
<p>
  Here is a little bit of history about the community around these
  discussions.  This community was born on the Freenode IRC network
  when I announced on the <code>##algorithms</code>
  and <code>##math</code> channels there that I would be hosting book
  reading and discussion meetings on analytic number theory.  I
  created a makeshift channel named
  <code>#susam</code> to discuss the book and plan the meeting
  schedule.  Several members joined this channel and we were ready to
  kick off our first meeting.
</p>
<p>
  Our first meeting occurred via IRC on 4 Mar 2021.  We realised that
  it would be much more efficient to discuss mathematics via audio
  along with a shared desktop session where we can use some software
  tool to scribble out and render mathematics formulas using LaTeX.
  So on the next day, that is, on 5 Mar 2021, we had our first web
  meeting.  Later,
  after <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26366464">an
  announcement on Hacker News</a>, some members from the Hacker News
  community joined our channel too and the community grew a little bit
  more as a result.

<p>
  We moved to Matrix later and now continue to operate out of
  the <a href="https://app.element.io/#/room/#susam:matrix.org">#susam:matrix.org</a>.
  It has now been more than 3 months since we began these meetings.
  Although our community is tiny, the meetings have been going on
  consistently and we have learnt numerous new and interesting
  concepts and theorems in the field of analytic number theory.  In
  this community, we pick classics from the field of mathematics and
  computation and read them together.
</p>
<p>
  Since this group was formed, we have made good progress with the
  study of analytic number theory.  The meetings for this topic have
  been going on consistently.  When I get some more free time now in
  future, I will add a few more topics for our meetings.
