  This post illustrates a key lemma that is used in proving
  the <em>fundamental theorem of Galois theory</em> (FTGT).  Note that
  FTGT is not covered in this post.  The focus of this post is on
  understanding and proving this lemma only.  Here is the lemma from
  the book <em>Galois Theory</em>, 5th ed. by Stewart (2023):
</p>
<div class="highlight">
  <p>
    <strong>Lemma 12.1.</strong>
    <em>
      Suppose that \( L/K \) is a field extension, \( M \) is an
      intermediate field, and \( \tau \) is a \( K \)-automorphism of \(
      L \).  Then \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1} = \tau(M)^{*} \).
    </em>
  </p>

  The notation \( M^* \) denotes the group of all
  \( M \)-automorphisms of \( L \) with composition as the group
  operation.  Note that Stewart writes \( \tau(M)^{*} = \tau M^*
  \tau^{-1} \) while stating the lemma but I have reversed the LHS and
  RHS to maintain consistency with the equations that appear in the
  discussion below.
</p>
<p>
  To build intuition for this lemma, I'll first present an
  illustration, followed by a proof.  The discussion below assumes
  familiarity with field extensions and field automorphisms, as
  several notations and results from these areas will be used
  implicitly without detailed justification.  This post is meant to
  serve as a set of notes on the lemma, not a comprehensive tutorial.

<p>
  Let \( L = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) \), \( K = \mathbb{Q} \)
  and \( M = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) \).  Note that

  \begin{align*}
    L &amp;= \{ a + b \sqrt{2} + c \sqrt{3} + d \sqrt{6} : a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{Q} \}, \\
    M &amp;= \{ k + l \sqrt{2} : k, l \in \mathbb{Q} \}.
  \end{align*}

  Now the group of \( K \)-automorphisms of \( L \) is

  \[
    K^* = \{\phi_1, \phi_2, \phi_3, \phi_4 \}
  \]

  where each \( \phi_i \) is given by

  \begin{align*}
    \phi_1 &amp;:
    a + b \sqrt{2} + c \sqrt{3} + d \sqrt{6} \mapsto
    a + b \sqrt{2} + c \sqrt{3} + d \sqrt{6}, \\

    \phi_2 &amp;:
    a + b \sqrt{2} + c \sqrt{3} + d \sqrt{6} \mapsto
    a - b \sqrt{2} + c \sqrt{3} - d \sqrt{6}, \\

    \phi_3 &amp;:
    a + b \sqrt{2} + c \sqrt{3} + d \sqrt{6} \mapsto
    a + b \sqrt{2} - c \sqrt{3} - d \sqrt{6}, \\

    \phi_4 &amp;:
    a + b \sqrt{2} + c \sqrt{3} + d \sqrt{6} \mapsto
    a - b \sqrt{2} - c \sqrt{3} + d \sqrt{6}.
  \end{align*}

  Then \( M^* = \{ \phi_1, \phi_3 \} \).  Let \( \tau = \phi_2 \).
  Then

  \begin{align*}
  \tau(M)
    &amp;= \{ \tau(x) : x \in \mathbb{M} \} \\
    &amp;= \{ \tau(k + l \sqrt{2}) : k, l \in \mathbb{Q} \} \\
    &amp;= \{ k - l \sqrt{2} : k, l \in \mathbb{Q} \}.
  \end{align*}

  Note that in this case we ended up with \( \tau(M) = M \) but we
  will be careful not to utilise this fact.  We will ensure that the
  steps below work without assuming \( \tau(M) = M \).  Next we find

  \begin{equation}
    \tau(M)^* = \{ \phi_1, \phi_3 \}.
    \label{eq-tau-m-ast}
  \end{equation}

  Now

  \begin{align*}
    \tau M^* \tau^{-1}
    &amp;= \{ \tau \gamma \tau^{-1} : \gamma \in {M^*} \} \\
    &amp;= \{ \tau \phi_1 \tau^{-1}, \tau \phi_3 \tau^{-1} \}.
  \end{align*}

  Let us now find out how each element of \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1} \)
  transforms the elements of \( L \).  For all \( a + b \sqrt{2} + c
  \sqrt{3} + d \sqrt{6} \in L \), we get

  \begin{align*}
    (\tau \phi_1 \tau^{-1})(a + b \sqrt{2} + c \sqrt{3} + d \sqrt{6})
    &amp;= (\tau \phi_1)(a - b\sqrt{2} + c\sqrt{3} - d\sqrt{6}) \\
    &amp;= \tau (a - b\sqrt{2} + c\sqrt{3} - d\sqrt{6}) \\
    &amp;= a + b\sqrt{2} + c\sqrt{3} + d\sqrt{6}).
  \end{align*}

  Therefore

  \[
    \tau \phi_1 \tau^{-1} = \phi_1.
  \]

  Similarly,

  \begin{align*}
    (\tau \phi_3 \tau^{-1})(a + b \sqrt{2} + c \sqrt{3} + d \sqrt{6})
    &amp;= (\tau \phi_3)(a - b\sqrt{2} + c\sqrt{3} - d\sqrt{6}) \\
    &amp;= \tau (a - b\sqrt{2} - c\sqrt{3} + d\sqrt{6}) \\
    &amp;= a + b\sqrt{2} - c\sqrt{3} - d\sqrt{6}.
  \end{align*}

  Therefore

  \[
    \tau \phi_3 \tau^{-1} = \phi_3.
  \]

  We have shown that

  \begin{equation}
    \tau M^* \tau^{-1} = \{ \phi_1, \phi_3 \}.
    \label{eq-tau-coset}
  \end{equation}

  From \( \eqnref{eq-tau-m-ast}{1} \) and \( \eqnref{eq-tau-coset}{2} \)
  we see that

  \[
     \tau M^* \tau^{-1} = \tau(M)^*.
  \]

  Since we are working with a concrete example of \( \tau \) here, we
  know exactly how it behaves, so we succeeded in demonstrating the
  above equality.  However, in a general proof, \( \tau \) is going to
  be an arbitrary \( K \)-automorphism of \( L \), so we cannot know
  exactly how it behaves and as a result, we cannot obtain the above
  equation directly.  Therefore, in a general proof, we we will first
  show that \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1} \subseteq \tau(M)^* \) and then we
  will show that \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1} \supseteq \tau(M)^* \) in order
  to prove the above equation.

<p>
  Once again, let us see how each element of \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1} \)
  transforms the elements of \( \tau(M) \).  Note that this time we
  are not going to examine how they transform arbitrary elements of \(
  L \).  We are only going to see how they transform the elements of
  \( \tau(M) \).  For all \( k - l \sqrt{2} \in \tau(M) \), we get

  \begin{align*}
    (\tau \phi_1 \tau^{-1})(k - l \sqrt{2})
    &amp;= (\tau \phi_1)(k + l \sqrt{2}) \\
    &amp;= \tau(k + l \sqrt{2}) \\
    &amp;= k - l \sqrt{2}.
  \end{align*}

  Similarly, for all \( k - l \sqrt{2} \in \tau(M) \), we get

  \begin{align*}
    (\tau \phi_3 \tau^{-1})(k - l \sqrt{2})
    &amp;= (\tau \phi_3)(k + l \sqrt{2}) \\
    &amp;= \tau(k + l \sqrt{2}) \\
    &amp;= k - l \sqrt{2}.
  \end{align*}

  Note above that both \( \phi_1 \) and \( \phi_3 \) fix \( k + l
  \sqrt{2} \in M \) because \( \phi_1, \phi_2 \in M^* \), the set of
  \( M \)-automorphisms of \( L \).  This detail will be used in the
  general proof.
</p>
<p>
  Since both \( \tau \phi_1 \tau^{-1} \) and
  \( \tau \phi_3 \tau^{-1} \) fix the elements of \( \tau(M) \), they
  are both \( \tau(M) \)-automorphisms of \( L \).  Therefore \( \tau
  M^* \tau^{-1} \subseteq \tau(M)^{*} \).
</p>
<h3 id="lhs-superset-of-rhs">LHS &supe; RHS</h3>
<p>
  Consider the set \( \tau^{-1} \tau(M)^* \tau \) and examine how its
  elements transform the elements of \( M \).  For all \( k + l
  \sqrt{2} \in M \), we get

  \begin{align*}
    (\tau^{-1} \phi_1 \tau)(k + l \sqrt{2})
    &amp;= (\tau^{-1} \phi_1)(k - \sqrt{2}) \\
    &amp;= \tau^{-1}(k - \sqrt{2}) \\
    &amp;= k + l \sqrt{2}.
  \end{align*}

  Similarly, for all \( k + l \sqrt{2} \in M \), we get

  \begin{align*}
    (\tau^{-1} \phi_3 \tau)(k + l \sqrt{2})
    &amp;= (\tau^{-1} \phi_3)(k - \sqrt{2}) \\
    &amp;= \tau^{-1}(k - \sqrt{2}) \\
    &amp;= k + l \sqrt{2}.
  \end{align*}

  Here both \( \phi_1 \) and \( \phi_3 \) fix \( k - l \sqrt{2} \in
  \tau(M) \) because \( \phi_1, \phi_2 \in \tau(M)^* \), the set of \(
  \tau(M) \)-automorphisms of \( L \).
</p>
<p>
  Since both \( \tau^{-1} \phi_1 \tau \) and
  \( \tau^{-1} \phi_3 \tau \) fix the elements of \( M \), they are
  both \( M \)-automorphisms of \( L \).  Therefore \( \tau^{-1}
  \tau(M)^* \tau \subseteq M^* \) which implies \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1}
  \supseteq \tau(M)^* \).
</p>
<h3 id="lhs-equals-rhs">LHS = RHS</h3>
<p>
  The previous two sections complete the illustration of the lemma
  with the chosen example.  We have shown that \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1}
  \subseteq \tau(M)^{*} \) and \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1} \supseteq
  \tau(M)^* \).  Therefore \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1} = \tau(M)^* \).
</p>
<h2 id="proof">Proof</h2>
<p>
  The ideas presented in the previous sections will now be extended to
  formulate a general proof.  For clarity, the lemma is stated once
  again below before proceeding with the proof.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Lemma 12.1.</strong>
  <em>
    Suppose that \( L/K \) is a field extension, \( M \) is an
    intermediate field, and \( \tau \) is a \( K \)-automorphism of \(
    L \).  Then \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1} = \tau(M)^{*} \).
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Proof.</em>

  For all \( \gamma \in M^* \), \( x' \in \tau(M) \), we use the
  notation \( x = \tau^{-1}(x') \in M \) and get

  \[
    (\tau \gamma \tau^{-1})(x') = (\tau \gamma)(x) = \tau(x) = x'.
  \]

  In the second equality above, we have used the fact that \( \gamma
  \in M^* \) which implies that \( \gamma \) is an \( M \)-automorphism
  of \( L \) which allows us to conclude that \( \gamma(x) = x \) for
  \( x \in M \).  Since every \( \tau \gamma \tau^{-1} \in \tau M^*
  \tau^{-1} \) fixes all elements \( x' \in \tau(M) \), each \( \tau
  \gamma \tau^{-1} \) must be a \( \tau(M) \)-automorphism of \( L \).
  Thus \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1} \subseteq \tau(M)^* \).
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, for all \( \gamma' \in \tau(M)^* \), \( x \in M \), we
  use the notation \( x' = \tau(x) \in \tau(M) \) and get

  \[
  (\tau^{-1} \gamma' \tau)(x) = (\tau^{-1} \gamma')(x') = \tau^{-1}(x') = x.
  \]

  In the second equality above, we have used the fact that \( \gamma'
  \in \tau(M)^* \) which implies that \( \gamma' \) is an
  \( \tau(M) \)-automorphism of \( L \) which allows us to conclude
  that \( \gamma'(x') = x' \) for \( x' \in \tau(M) \).  Since every
  \( \tau^{-1} \gamma' \tau \in \tau^{-1} \tau(M)^* \tau \) fixes all
  elements \( x \in M \), each \( \tau^{-1} \gamma' \tau \) must be an
  \( M \)-automorphism of \( L \).  Thus \( \tau^{-1} \tau(M)^* \tau
  \subseteq M^* \).  This implies \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1} \supseteq
  \tau(M)^* \).
</p>
<p>
  We have shown that \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1} \subseteq \tau(M)^* \) and
  \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1} \supseteq \tau(M)^* \).  Therefore \( \tau M^*
  \tau^{-1} = \tau(M)^* \).
