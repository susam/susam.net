  I recently came across a beautiful and thoughtful answer on
  MathOverflow by the late mathematician William Thurston.  A brief
  background about him from
  the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Thurston">Wikipedia
  article</a> about him:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    William Paul Thurston (October 30, 1946 &ndash; August 21, 2012)
    was an American mathematician.  He was a pioneer in the field of
    low-dimensional topology and was awarded the Fields Medal in 1982
    for his contributions to the study of 3-manifolds.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thurston was a professor of mathematics at Princeton University,
    University of California at Davis and Cornell University.  He was
    also a director of the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute.

  Thurston posted his answer while replying to a MathOverflow
  question:
  <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/q/43690"><em>What's a
  mathematician to do?</em></a>.  The question enquires about how an
  ordinary mathematician can contribute to mathematics.  Thurston's
  answer
  from <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/a/44213">mathoverflow.net/a/44213</a>
  is reproduced below:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    It's not <em>mathematics</em> that you need to contribute to.
    It's deeper than that: how might you contribute to humanity, and
    even deeper, to the well-being of the world, by pursuing
    mathematics?  Such a question is not possible to answer in a
    purely intellectual way, because the effects of our actions go far
    beyond our understanding.  We are deeply social and deeply
    instinctual animals, so much that our well-being depends on many
    things we do that are hard to explain in an intellectual way.
    That is why you do well to follow your heart and your passion.
    Bare reason is likely to lead you astray.  None of us are smart
    and wise enough to figure it out intellectually.
  </p>
  <p>
    The product of mathematics is clarity and understanding.  Not
    theorems, by themselves.  Is there, for example any real reason
    that even such famous results as Fermat's Last Theorem, or the
    Poincaré conjecture, really matter?  Their real importance is not
    in their specific statements, but their role in challenging our
    understanding, presenting challenges that led to mathematical
    developments that increased our understanding.
  </p>
  <p>
    The world does not suffer from an oversupply of clarity and
    understanding (to put it mildly).  How and whether specific
    mathematics might lead to improving the world (whatever that
    means) is usually impossible to tease out, but mathematics
    collectively is extremely important.
  </p>
  <p>
    I think of mathematics as having a large component of psychology,
    because of its strong dependence on human minds.  Dehumanized
    mathematics would be more like computer code, which is very
    different.  Mathematical ideas, even simple ideas, are often hard
    to transplant from mind to mind.  There are many ideas in
    mathematics that may be hard to get, but are easy once you get
    them.  Because of this, mathematical understanding does not expand
    in a monotone direction.  Our understanding frequently
    deteriorates as well.  There are several obvious mechanisms of
    decay.  The experts in a subject retire and die, or simply move on
    to other subjects and forget.  Mathematics is commonly explained
    and recorded in symbolic and concrete forms that are easy to
    communicate, rather than in conceptual forms that are easy to
    understand once communicated.  Translation in the direction
    conceptual -&gt; concrete and symbolic is much easier than
    translation in the reverse direction, and symbolic forms often
    replaces the conceptual forms of understanding.  And mathematical
    conventions and taken-for-granted knowledge change, so older texts
    may become hard to understand.
  </p>
  <p>
    In short, mathematics only exists in a living community of
    mathematicians that spreads understanding and breaths life into
    ideas both old and new.  The real satisfaction from mathematics is
    in learning from others and sharing with others.  All of us have
    clear understanding of a few things and murky concepts of many
    more.  There is no way to run out of ideas in need of
    clarification.  The question of who is the first person to ever
    set foot on some square meter of land is really secondary.
    Revolutionary change does matter, but revolutions are few, and
    they are not self-sustaining --- they depend very heavily on the
    community of mathematicians.

  In the comments to the answer, one of the commenters
  was <a href="https://users.cs.utah.edu/~suresh/">Suresh
  Venkatasubramanian</a> who was a professor in the School of
  Computing at the University of Utah back then.  He
  is <a href="https://vivo.brown.edu/display/suresh">now</a> a
  professor of Computer Science and Data Science at Brown University.
  In his <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/43690/whats-a-mathematician-to-do/44213#comment271029_44213">comment</a>,
  Suresh proposed that this answer be called <em>Thurston's
  Paean</em>.  Here is his complete comment:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    This seems like an ideal counterpoint to Hardy's Lament.  I'm
    calling it Thurston's Paean :).  Seems poignant now that he has
    passed.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Thurston's answer does appear to be a perfect complement to Hardy's
  lament in the 1940 essay <em>A Mathematician's Apology</em>.  While
  Hardy's lament is remarkably beautiful and introspective, it may
  also feel a little depressing at places.  Thurston's post on the
  other hand is full of hope and purpose that goes beyond the actual
  work of doing mathematics.  Indeed <em>Thurston's Paean</em> is a
  befitting title for his answer.
