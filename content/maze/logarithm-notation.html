  We know that the natural logarithm of a number \( x \), i.e., the
  logarithm of \( x \) to the base \( e \), is sometimes denoted as \(
  \ln x \).  It has other notations too.  For example, many
  mathematics textbooks just use the notation \( \log x \) after
  establishing once that this notation denotes the natural logarithm.
  The most descriptive notation is perhaps \( \log_e x \) but this is
  most definitely an overkill.  I have never seen any serious textbook
  use this notation.

  Let us focus on \( \ln x \) again.  Is it not peculiar?  What does
  \( \ln \) stand for really?  Logarithm natural?  Sounds very unnatural.

  Well, as a kid I learnt that \( \ln \) here stands for the Latin
  phrase "logarithmus naturalis".  It is only recently that I bothered
  to verify if this expansion of \( \ln x \) that I learnt as a kid is
  really true.  The most credible discussion of this that I could find
  online is this thread on Mathematics Stack Exchange:
  <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/q/1694">math.stackexchange.com/q/1694</a>.
  The answer by Dan Velleman points us to page 277 of an 1875
  book <em>Lehrbuch der Mathematik</em> by Anton Steinhauser.  Quoting
  the relevant portion from the page:
</p>
<blockquote>
  Man pflegt nun, um Verwechslungen dieser beiden Systeme vorzubeugen,
  mit log.nat. a (gesprochen: logarithmus naturalis a) oder ln . a,
  oder am einfachsten mit la den nat√ºrlichen, mit log.brigg. a
  (gesprochen: Logarithmus briggus a) oder log.a, oder am einfachsten
  mit lg. a den gemeinen Logarithmus (von a) zu bezeichnen.
</blockquote>
<p>
  Translated to English, it says:
</p>
<blockquote>
  In order to prevent confusion between these two systems, people now
  use log.nat. a (pronounced: logarithmus naturalis a) or ln . a, or
  easiest with la the natural ones, with log.brigg. a (pronounced:
  logarithm briggus a) or log.a, or most simply with lg. a to denote
  the common logarithm (of a).
</blockquote>
<p>
  So it does look like what I learnt as a kid is correct and the
  earliest possible reference of this the Internet is able to find for
  us is the 1875 book quoted above.
