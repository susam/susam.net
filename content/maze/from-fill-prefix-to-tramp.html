  Our <a href="cc/mastering-emacs/{{ index }}">tiny book club</a> that
  used to meet during the weekends and holidays and discuss the
  book <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/">Mastering Emacs</a>,
  2022 edition concluded today.  In our
  <a href="cc/mastering-emacs/log.html#72">final meeting</a> today,
  we first discussed how to work across multiple directories in the
  same Dired buffer.  Then we did several demos of the various shells
  and terminal modes available in Emacs out of the box.  That
  completed our discussion on Chapter 6.  Then we moved on to Chapter
  7 (the final chapter) that first reiterates the importance of using
  the describe-system to ask Emacs questions about itself and then
  offers some recommendations about third-party packages and online
  Emacs communities.  Completing this chapter brought our book club
  discussions to an end.
</p>
<p>
  A big thanks to Mickey Petersen for writing the book and also very
  generously granting me the permission to share his book on screen
  while discussing it.
</p>
<p>
  This book club began on 16 Dec 2022 when we had our first meeting
  over Jitsi.  About 3&half; months after beginning these meetings, I
  posted an update about this book club in another blog post
  titled <a href="from-lunar-phases-to-yank-pop.html">From Lunar
  Phases to Yank-Pop</a>.  If you have not read that post yet, I
  suggest you read it before returning to this post.  Especially if
  you have recently begun learning Emacs, I think you will find that
  post useful.
</p>
<p>
  Back then, when I posted that last update, we had spent about 26
  hours together across 36 meetings and we were reading Chapter 5 of
  the book.  It took another 36 meetings to complete that chapter and
  the remaining two chapters.  After a total of 72 meetings, we
  completed discussing Chapter 7 of the book today which concluded
  this series of book club meetings.  In total, we have spent a little
  over 52 hours together to discuss this book, trying out every
  concept and command introduced in the book, and sharing our insights
  about the material with each other.
</p>
<p>
  In this post, I will share some highlights from our meetings since
  the <a href="from-lunar-phases-to-yank-pop.html">last update</a>.
  These highlights share some concepts and commands we learnt that
  most members of our book club were not familiar with earlier but
  were found to be very useful after having learnt them.

<h2 id="fill-prefix">Fill Prefix</h2>
<p>
  Most of us in the book discussion group knew about filling
  paragraphs with <code>M-q</code>.  Consider the following badly
  formatted paragraphs with very long and very short lines:
</p>
<pre>
<code>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor
incididunt ut labore et dolore
magna aliqua.  Arcu dui vivamus arcu felis bibendum ut tristique et egestas.
Bibendum arcu vitae
elementum curabitur vitae.</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Now put the point (cursor) anywhere on the paragraph and
  type <code>M-q</code>.  The paragraph gets neatly formatted to
  something like this:
</p>
<pre>
<code>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do
eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.  Arcu dui
vivamus arcu felis bibendum ut tristique et egestas.  Bibendum arcu
vitae elementum curabitur vitae.</code>
</pre>
<p>
  The key sequence <code>M-q</code> invokes
  the <code>fill-paragraph</code> command that reformats the paragraph
  such that each line is as long as possible without exceeding the
  fill width (70 columns by default).  Most of us already used this
  command very often while writing and editing text.  However what
  some of us did not know was that there is such a thing as fill
  prefix which is taken into account while filling paragraphs.  To
  illustrate this concept, we will first consider this badly formatted
  paragraph:
</p>
<pre>
<code>:::: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor
:::: incididunt ut labore et dolore
:::: magna aliqua.  Arcu dui vivamus arcu felis bibendum ut tristique et egestas.
:::: Bibendum arcu vitae
:::: elementum curabitur vitae.</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Each line has a prefix consisting of four colons and a space.  After
  we reformat this paragraph with <code>M-q</code>, we get something
  like this:
</p>
<pre>
<code>:::: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do
eiusmod tempor :::: incididunt ut labore et dolore :::: magna aliqua.
Arcu dui vivamus arcu felis bibendum ut tristique et egestas.  ::::
Bibendum arcu vitae :::: elementum curabitur vitae.</code>
</pre>
<p>
  This is not what we want.  We want the paragraph to be formatted
  such that each line does not exceed 70 characters in length (which
  we have, in fact, accomplished above) and each line contains the
  four colons and a space as the prefix (this is broken above).  Can
  we do this?  Yes, by setting the fill prefix.  Type <code>C-/</code>
  or <code>C-x u</code> to undo the bad formatting we did just now and
  let us try again.  This time move the point over to
  the <code>L</code> of <code>Lorem</code> and type <code>C-x .</code>
  to set the fill prefix to the current line up to the point.  A
  confirmation is printed in the echo area that <code>":::: "</code>
  has been set as the fill prefix.  Then type <code>M-q</code> and the
  paragraph is now neatly formatted to look like this:
</p>
<pre>
<code>:::: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do
:::: eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.  Arcu
:::: dui vivamus arcu felis bibendum ut tristique et egestas.
:::: Bibendum arcu vitae elementum curabitur vitae.</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Note how every line is as long as possible without exceeding 70
  characters in length and each line has the fill prefix.  Emacs took
  care to remove the fill prefix from each line, subtract the length
  of the fill prefix from the maximum character budget it has for each
  line, reformat the lines, and then reinsert the fill prefix on each
  line of the result.
</p>
<p>
  To turn off the fill prefix, simply set it to an empty prefix by
  typing <code>C-x .</code> at the beginning of the line.
  Thus <code>C-a C-x .</code> becomes an idiom for turning off the
  fill prefix.
</p>
<h2 id="elisp-expressions-in-replacement-strings">Elisp Expressions in Replacement Strings</h2>
<p>
  It was no surprise to anyone in the book discussion group that the
  key sequence <code>C-M-% f.. RET bar RET</code> starts a
  search-and-replace operation for strings that match the regular
  expression pattern <code>f..</code> to be replaced with the
  text <code>bar</code>.
</p>
<p>
  The concept of backreferences was also known to most.  For
  example, <code>C-M-% \(f..\)-\(b..\) RET \2-\1 RET</code> searches
  for strings matching the given regular expression pattern and
  replaces it with a new string that swaps the positions of the first
  capturing group and the second capturing group.  The
  backreference <code>\1</code> refers to the string matched by the
  first capturing group <code>\(f..\)</code> and
  similarly <code>\2</code> refers to the string matched by the second
  capturing group <code>\(b..\)</code>.  In this example, a string
  like <code>foo-bar</code> is replaced with <code>bar-foo</code>,
  or <code>playful-banter</code> with <code>playban-fulter</code>.
</p>
<p>
  However what came as a surprise to some of us was that we could also
  use Elisp expressions in the replacement strings.  The syntax to do
  so is to write <code>\,</code> followed by the Elisp expression in
  the replacement string.  For example, consider the key
  sequence <code>C-M-% f.. RET \,(upcase \&) RET</code>.  Note how we
  are using the backreference <code>\&</code> that refers to the whole
  match as the argument to the Elisp function <code>upcase</code> that
  converts its argument to upper-case.  This example searches for
  strings that match the pattern <code>f..</code> and replaces them
  with the upper-case form of the match.  A string
  like <code>foo-bar</code> is replaced with <code>FOO-bar</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Here is another slightly more sophisticated example: <code>C-M-%
  port-\([0-9]+\) RET port-\,(+ 1000 \#1)</code>.  The
  backreference <code>\#1</code> refers to the string matched by the
  first capturing group <code>\([0-9]+\)</code> as <em>number</em>.
  The Elisp expression in the replacement pattern simply adds 1000 to
  that number and replaces the matched string with the result.  A
  string like <code>port-80</code> becomes <code>port-1080</code>.
</p>
<h2 id="keep-lines-and-flush-lines">Keep Lines and Flush Lines</h2>
<p>
  A nifty set of commands that our group members enjoyed learning were
  the commands for keeping and flushing lines.  These commands can be
  incredibly useful while filtering large log files.  Here is a brief
  illustration of a couple of these commands:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>M-x keep-lines RET f.. RET</code>: Keep lines in region
      that match the regular expression <code>f..</code> and delete
      the rest.  If no region is active, then keep matching lines
      between the point and end of buffer, and delete the rest.  The
      deleted lines are not copied to kill ring.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>M-x flush-lines RET f.. RET</code>: Delete lines in the
      region that match the regular expression <code>f..</code>.  If
      no region is active, then delete matching lines between the
      point and end of buffer.  The deleted lines are not copied to
      kill ring.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Note how each point above mentions that the deleted lines are not
  copied to the kill ring.  This can be an inconvenience if we want to
  quickly yank the deleted lines to another buffer.  Emacs 28.1
  introduces a couple of more commands that remedy this situation to
  an extent.  Here they are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>M-x copy-matching-lines RET f.. RET</code>: Copy lines in
      the region that match the regular expression <code>f..</code>.
      If no region is active, then copy matching lines between the
      point and end of buffer.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>M-x kill-matching-lines RET f.. RET</code>: Kill lines in
      region that match the regular expression <code>f..</code> to the
      kill ring.  If no region is active, then kill matching lines
      between the point and end of buffer.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="keyboard-macros">Keyboard Macros</h2>
<p>
  Most experienced Emacs users in our group were aware of keyboard
  macros.  However, some people did learn this wonderful automation
  feature for the first time in our meetings, so I thought this
  deserves its own section in this post.
</p>
<p>
  Keyboard macros is a large topic on its own which is best learnt
  from
  section <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Keyboard-Macros.html">Keyboard
  Macros</a> of the manual.  On Emacs, type <code>M-: (info "(emacs)
  Keyboard Macros") RET</code> to open this section using the Info
  documentation browser.  In this blog post though, we will very
  briefly talk about keyboard macros that should be enough to get
  someone very new to it started with them quickly.
</p>
<p>
  Say, we have a buffer that looks like this:
</p>
<pre>
<code>foo:bar:baz
bar:baz:qux
quux:corge:grault
garply:waldo:fred</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Now suppose we want to swap the first two fields separated by colon
  in each line.  Of course, we could do it using regular expressions,
  for example, with the key sequence
  <code>C-M-% ^\(.+?:\)\(.+?:\) RET \2\1 RET</code>.  But we can also
  solve this problem in a "dumb" way by simply performing the edits
  necessary to do the swap on one line and then asking Emacs to repeat
  what we did on the other lines.  Here are the steps:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      First move the point to somewhere on the first line.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Then type <code>C-x (</code> to start recording a keyboard
      macro.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Then type <code>C-a M-d C-d M-f : C-y C-n</code> to swap the
      first and second fields on the first line and move the point to
      the next line.  This is just one way to achieve the swap.  You
      may use any editing commands you are comfortable with to make
      the swap happen and move the point to the next line.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Now type <code>C-x )</code> to stop macro recording.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Now type <code>C-x e</code> to replay the macro in the second
      line.  As soon as we type this key sequence, the swap occurs in
      the second line and the cursor moves to the third line.  Keep
      repeating this key sequence to keep repeating the swap operation
      on subsequent lines.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  To summarise, <code>C-x (</code> starts recording a new keyboard
  macro, <code>C-x )</code> stops recording the keyboard macro,
  and <code>C-x e</code> replays the last keyboard macro.
  Alternatively, we could also use the function keys <code>F3</code>
  and <code>F4</code>.  To start recording a keyboard macro,
  type <code>F3</code>.  Type <code>F4</code> to stop recording a
  keyboard macro.  Then type <code>F4</code> again to replay the last
  macro.
</p>
<p>
  Pay close attention to step 3 above.  We start the key sequence
  with <code>C-a</code> to move the point to the first column.  This
  may feel redundant when the cursor is already at the first column.
  However in our meetings, I used to emphasise often about the
  importance of doing this.  Typing <code>C-a</code> at the beginning
  ensures that we do not carry over any assumption about where the
  cursor is on the line into the rest of the keyboard macro definition
  we are going to record.  By typing <code>C-a</code>, we ensure that
  no matter where the cursor is on the line, when we replay the macro,
  the cursor would first move to the beginning of the line.  This
  guarantee allows us to confidently define the rest of the editing
  operations necessary to perform the swap.
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, at the end we type <code>C-n</code> to move the point to
  the next line.  I used to emphasise the importance of doing this too
  in our meetings.  Moving the cursor to the next line ensures that
  the cursor is in a good place to allow repeating the keyboard macro
  again immediately.  This is why we could type <code>C-x e</code> (or
  alternatively, <code>F4</code>) over and over again to replay the
  macro on subsequent lines.  In fact, if we feel confident about the
  keyboard macro, we can repeat it several times automatically using
  the digit argument.  For example, type <code>C-3 C-x e</code> (or
  alternatively <code>C-3 F4</code>) to repeat the keyboard macro 3
  times.  We could also type <code>C-0 C-x e</code> (or
  alternatively <code>C-0 F4</code>) to repeat the keyboard macro
  until there is an error (e.g., reaching the end of the buffer).
</p>
<h2 id="dabbrev">DAbbrev</h2>
<p>
  DAbbrev stands for <em>dynamic abbrevation</em>.  This is a pretty
  useful package that many of us learnt only from our book club
  meetings.  We discussed two simple key sequences supported by this
  package:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>M-/</code>: Expand the word before the point to the
      nearest preceding word for which the current word is a prefix.
      If no suitable preceding word is found, then expand the current
      word to the nearest succeeding word for which the current word
      is a prefix.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>C-M-/</code>: Find all words in the buffer that has the
      current word before the cursor as the prefix and expand the
      current word to the longest common prefix of all these matching
      words.  However, if the longest common prefix of the matching
      words is same as the word before the cursor, then present them
      as suggestions for completion.  If there is exactly one matching
      word, expand the word before the cursor to that word.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Let us look at some examples.  Suppose there is a buffer with the
  following one line of text:
</p>
<pre><code>abacus apple appliance application</code></pre>
<p>
  Now if we type <code>ap</code> on the next line and
  type <code>M-/</code>, DAbbrev automatically expands the partially
  written word to <code>application</code> because that is the nearest
  word that has <code>ap</code> as the prefix.
</p>
<p>
  But if we type <code>ap</code> and type <code>C-M-/</code>, the word
  expands to <code>appl</code> since that is the longest common prefix
  among all the matching words.  If we type <code>C-M-/</code> again,
  then <code>apple</code>, <code>appliance</code>,
  and <code>application</code> are presented as possible completions
  in a temporary buffer named <code>*Completions*</code>.  If we
  type <code>ic</code>, so that the word before the cursor
  becomes <code>applic</code>, and type <code>C-M-/</code>, it is
  expanded to <code>application</code> because that is the only
  possible completion now.
</p>
<p>
  These two commands are simpler than it sounds from the verbose
  descriptions of these commands presented in the above paragraphs.
  When we actually begin to use them, they become intuitive in no
  time.  Roughly speaking, while <code>M-/</code> expands the word
  before the point to the nearest preceding word, <code>C-M-/</code>
  considers all matching words in the file for expansion and presents
  completion options to the user when it finds multiple of them.
</p>
<h2 id="tab-vs-m-i">TAB vs M-i</h2>
<p>
  The behaviour of Emacs when we type <code>TAB</code> can be
  surprising to beginners.  In most other mainstream editors, this key
  either inserts a tab character or it inserts enough number of spaces
  so that the cursor moves to the next tab stop.  But in
  Emacs, <code>TAB</code> most often indents the current line
  according to the syntax rules implemented by the major mode enabled
  in the buffer.
</p>
<p>
  What is a simple key on other editors happens to be a complex
  feature in Emacs.  The exact behaviour of <code>TAB</code> is
  controlled by variables
  like <code>tab-always-indent</code>, <code>indent-line-function</code>,
  etc.  Some major modes may refer to other such special variables to
  decide what <code>TAB</code> should do.  However, as a user of Emacs
  this is not something we normally have to worry about.  Most major
  modes set up all these variables appropriately, so that
  <code>TAB</code> almost always does what an experienced Emacs user
  expects, i.e., indent the current line of code correctly.
</p>
<p>
  But what if we really do want to just insert a tab or enough number
  of spaces to move the point to the next tab stop column?  That is
  done with <code>M-i</code>.  If the
  variable <code>indent-tabs-mode</code> is set to <code>t</code>,
  then <code>M-i</code> inserts a literal tab character.  If it is set
  to <code>nil</code>, then <code>M-i</code> inserts enough number of
  spaces to move the point to the next tab stop column.
</p>
<p>
  To summarise, the behaviour of <code>M-i</code> is similar to
  the <code>TAB</code> behaviour we observe in other editors.  In
  practice though, the key sequence <code>M-i</code> is rarely
  required.  Most people just type <code>TAB</code> to automatically
  indent code.  In fact, we can also select a region of code and
  type <code>TAB</code> to reindent the whole region.
</p>
<h2 id="project-management">Project Management</h2>
<p>
  The project management commands that come out of the box (from the
  package named <code>project.el</code>) came as a surprise to some.
  In fact, some members of our group who never used the project
  management commands earlier happen to use them regularly now after
  learning about them in our meetings.
</p>
<p>
 When we use a project command like <code>C-x p f</code> to visit a
 file in the current project, the command automatically detects the
 top-level directory of the project by checking parent directories for
 version control system artefacts (e.g., <code>.git</code> directory)
 and presents files within that top-level directory as autocomplete
 options.
</p>
<p>
  There is a lot that can be written about the project management
  features that come out of the box in Emacs.  The following list
  introduces only the very simple ones to get someone started with
  them:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>C-x p f logger RET</code>: Find file with name that
      matches <code>logger</code> in the current project.  This
      searches all subdirectories recursively.  If there is only one
      matching file (say, <code>src/logger.cc</code>), that file is
      opened.  If there are multiple matching files, they are
      presented as completion options.  Running this command or, in
      fact, running any project command leads to discovering the
      current project and adding an entry for the discovered project
      to <code>~/.emacs.d/projects</code>.  This is useful for a
      command like the one presented in the next point.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>C-x p f foo TAB RET logger TAB RET</code>: When we
      type <code>C-x p f</code> while visiting a file that does not
      belong to any project, then its prompts for a project path
      first.  In this example, we type <code>foo TAB RET</code> to
      automatically expand it to a known project path such
      as <code>~/git/foo/</code> and enter it.  Then we
      type <code>logger TAB RET</code> to automatically expand it to a
      file name such as <code>src/logger.cc</code> and visit it.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>C-x p p bar TAB RET f logger TAB RET</code>: Say we are in
      project <code>~/git/foo/</code> but we want to switch to another
      previously discovered project <code>~/git/bar/</code> and find a
      file there.  To do so, we first type <code>C-x p p</code> to
      switch project.  At the project selection prompt, we
      type <code>bar TAB</code> to automatically complete the
      directory path of the known project <code>~/git/bar/</code>.
      Then another prompt is presented to choose an action from a
      number of actions.  In this case, we type <code>f</code> to find
      a file in the project we have switched to.  Finally, we
      type <code>logger TAB RET</code> to automatically expand the
      partially entered name to a path like <code>src/logger.cc</code>
      and visit it.  The key sequence <code>C-x p p</code> is very
      useful when the current file belongs to one project but we want
      to run a project command on another project.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>C-x p p ... RET ~/git/baz/ RET f logger TAB RET</code>:
      This awkward key sequence discovers a new project directory
      at <code>~/git/baz/</code> and then finds a file in it.  The key
      sequence <code>C-x p p ... RET</code> is rarely required though.
      See the notes after the end of this list to read why.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>C-x p g ^key\&gt; RET</code>: Find all matches for the
      regular expression <code>^key\&gt;</code> in the current
      project.  The results are displayed in <code>*xref*</code>
      buffer.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>C-x p s</code>: Start a shell in the current project's
      root directory.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>C-x p d</code>: Start Dired in the current project's root
      directory.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>C-x p k yes RET</code>: Kill all buffers belonging to the
      current project.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  There are several more project commands but we will end the above
  list here for the sake of brevity.  Do pay attention to the second
  point that mentions that if the current file does not belong to any
  project, we are first prompted to enter the project name.  This is a
  common theme for all project commands.  Anytime we invoke a project
  command, it works on the current project.  However if there is no
  current project, then it automatically prompts us to enter a project
  name before executing the command.
</p>
<p>
  The key sequence <code>C-x p p ... RET</code> is very rarely
  required during day-to-day editing activities.  Once a project has
  been discovered (say, due to having run a project command on that
  project earlier) and added to the list of known projects
  at <code>~/.emacs.d/projects</code>, we never have to discover it
  again.  We can use the other key sequences to switch to or work on a
  known project.  Most day-to-day project activities involve working
  on known projects.
</p>
<p>
  Further, even when we do want to discover a new project and add it
  to the list of known projects, a much more natural way to do it is
  to run a project command while we are visiting a file in the project
  directory.  In most cases, we already have a file from some project
  open in the current buffer.  Therefore it makes more sense to just
  go ahead with a project command, say, with <code>C-x p
  f</code>, <code>C-x p g</code>, etc. directly instead of explicitly
  discovering the project with <code>C-x p p ... RET</code>.  Merely
  running a project command while we have a file from a project open
  ends up discovering the current project automatically.  Explicitly
  discovering projects with <code>C-x p p ... RET</code> is almost
  never necessary.
</p>
<h2 id="eshell-with-tramp">Eshell with TRAMP</h2>
<p>
  Many members of our group knew about Eshell and TRAMP separately.
  For example, <code>M-x eshell RET</code> starts Eshell.  Eshell is
  implemented purely in Elisp and we can use it much like a regular
  shell.  Here is an example session:
</p>
<pre>

  We also knew about TRAMP.  For example, when we type the key
  sequence <code>C-x C-f /ssh:alice@box:/tmp/foo.txt RET</code>, TRAMP
  notices that we intend to connect to a remote system
  named <code>box</code> as the user <code>alice</code> via SSH and
  edit a file named <code>/tmp/foo.txt</code> on the remote system.
  TRAMP then transparently establishes the SSH connection for us.  If
  public key authentication is already set up, then the connection is
  successfully established immediately.  Otherwise it prompts for a
  password.  In the end, we get a buffer to edit the remote
  file <code>/tmp/foo.txt</code>.  Once we have this buffer, we never
  have to do anything special to work on the remote file.  All Emacs
  commands work seamlessly on this buffer for the remote file.  For
  example, when we type <code>C-x C-s</code> TRAMP would go ahead and
  save the file to the remote system using the established SSH
  connection.  If we type <code>C-x d</code>, TRAMP would create a
  Dired buffer for the remote directory <code>/tmp/</code>.  All the
  Emacs commands for working with files and directories we know just
  work fine with the remote file or directory.

  So we knew about Eshell and we knew about TRAMP.  However what many
  of us found pleasantly surprising was how remarkably well Eshell and
  TRAMP work together.  Here is an example Eshell session that
  illustrates this point:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>~ $ <kbd>cd /ssh:alice@box:/tmp/</kbd>
/ssh:alice@box:/tmp $ <kbd>echo foo &gt; foo.txt</kbd>
/ssh:alice@box:/tmp $ <kbd>ls</kbd>
foo.txt
/ssh:alice@box:/tmp $ <kbd>cd /tmp/</kbd>
/tmp $ <kbd>echo bar &gt; bar.txt</kbd>
/tmp $ <kbd>ls</kbd>
bar.txt
/tmp $ <kbd>cp /ssh:alice@box:/tmp/foo.txt .</kbd>
/tmp $ <kbd>ls</kbd>
bar.txt  foo.txt
/tmp $</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  Look at how the command <code>cd /ssh:alice@box:/tmp/</code> above
  has seamlessly and transparently set the current directory of the
  shell to the remote directory.  When we create a file after that, it
  gets created on the remote directory!  We can work across
  directories opened with multiple TRAMP methods too.  For example
  first consider this session where the current local user does not
  have the permissions to write to the local <code>/etc/</code>
  directory:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>~ $ <kbd>cp /ssh:alice@box:/etc/wgetrc /etc/</kbd>
Opening output file Permission denied /etc/wgetrc</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  But if the current user has <code>sudo</code> privilege, we can do
  something like this:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>~ $ <kbd>cp /ssh:alice@box:/etc/wgetrc /sudo::/etc/</kbd>
~ $ <kbd>ls /etc/wgetrc</kbd>
/etc/wgetrc</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  We copied a file from a remote system and wrote it to a protected
  directory on the local system by using the <code>sudo</code>
  privilege.  We used the <code>ssh</code> method to read a remote
  file and the <code>sudo</code> method to write the file to a
  protected local directory.  TRAMP really does live up to its
  name: <em>Transparent Remote Access, Multiple Protocol</em>!

  It has been a pleasure hosting these Emacs book club meetings
  throughout this year.  I have really enjoyed discussing the book in
  great detail, examining each new concept introduced in the book
  carefully, and performing demos to illustrate the concepts.  A big
  thank you to the Emacs communities on Libera and Matrix networks who
  showed interest in these meetings, joined these meetings,
  participated in the discussions, and helped make these meetings
  successful!
