<!-- title: Leap Year Test in K&amp;R -->
<!-- tag: C Programming Technology Book -->
<p>
  I learnt the following test for leap year early in my programming
  life from the book <em>The C Programming Language, 2nd ed.</em>
  (K&amp;R) written by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie about 18
  years ago during my engineering studies. &sect; 2.5
  (Arithmetic Operators) of the book uses the following test:
</p>
<pre>
<code>(year % 4 == 0 &amp;&amp; year % 100 != 0) || year % 400 == 0</code>
</pre>
<p>
  By the way, the following test also works:
</p>
<pre>
<code>year % 4 == 0 &amp;&amp; (year % 100 != 0 || year % 400 == 0)</code>
</pre>
