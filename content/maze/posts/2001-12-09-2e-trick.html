<p>
  There are two interesting vulnerabilities in Microsoft IIS 3.0 that
  allow remote attackers to view the source code of dynamic web pages
  written using ASP. Both are related and both are due to improper
  input validation by IIS 3.0.

<h2 id="appending-dot">Appending Dot</h2>
<p>
  The first vulnerability allows the client to retrieve the source
  code of an ASP script by simply appending a dot
  (i.e., <code>.</code>) to the end of the URL. For example, while an
  URL like
</p>
<pre><code>http://example.com/foo.asp</code></pre>
<p>
  shows the output
  of <code>foo.asp</code>, the same URL when modified
  to
</p>
<pre><code>http://example.com/foo.asp.</code></pre> shows its source
  code.

<h2 id="replacing-dit-with-2e">Replacing Dot With %2E</h2>
<p>
  The second vulnerability, discovered by Weld Pond, is an issue that
  was introduced when the first issue was fixed by Microsoft. This
  vulnerability allows a client to retrieve the source code of an ASP
  script by changing the dot in the filename with its URL-encoding,
  i.e., <code>%2e</code>. For example, while an URL like
</p>
<pre><code>http://example.com/foo.asp</code></pre>
<p>
  shows the output
  of <code>foo.asp</code>, the same URL when modified
  to
</p>
<pre><code>http://example.com/foo%2easp.</code></pre> shows its source
  code.
</p>
<p>
  Note that <code>2e</code> is the hexadecimal representation of the
  ASCII code of the dot character. Here is a tiny C program that
  demonstrates this:
</p>
<pre>
<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
    printf("'%c', %d, %#x\n", '.', '.', '.');
    return 0;
}</code>
</pre>
Here is the output:
<pre>
<samp>$ cc foo.c && ./a.out
'.', 46, 0x2e</samp>
</pre>
<p>
