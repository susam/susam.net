I first came to know about Sunny Vaghela about one and a half years ago
when I got an email from <a

Sun Microsystems (now acquired by Oracle).

Hi Susam,
</p>
<p>
I just read the Orkut exploit on your site <a
href="http://susam.in/security/advisory-2007-06-22.txt">http://susam.in/security/advisory-2007-06-22.txt</a>.
It seems this guy, Sunny Vaghela, claims this exploit to be his own (<a
href="http://sunnyvaghela.com/orkut-hacking.html">http://sunnyvaghela.com/orkut-hacking.html</a>).
He also claims that people from Google visited him (<a

What's your take on this?

Hi Sandeep,
</p>
<p>
In our security advisory, we have documented that the session management
vulnerability associated with orkut_session cookie was first reported by
Net-Square Solutions Private Limited. We published an advisory in 2007
because even though the Net-Square advisory mentioned that the
vulnerability is fixed, we found that it wasn't. So, we published the
results of our investigation and experiments.
</p>
<p>
The link that you have sent me doesn't mention that he claims the
exploit to be his own. I have not seen the Headline Today video on his
work. However, if he does claim that it is his own exploit, either he
has discovered the vulnerability independently and is unaware of related
work that has been done before or he is using information from the
advisories published by us and Net-Square but claiming it to be his
own.
</p>
<p>

Hi Susam,
</p>
<p>
He has put it under "Research" on his site and also in the interview he
says he "found" this exploit. Well I have reading up about him recently
and this came up. So I thought I would alert you. Thanks for the
response.

Hi Sandip,
</p>
<p>
Thanks for the alert. I was assuming that he was talking about his work
in good faith. There is a possibility, no matter however small, that he
has discovered the vulnerability independently and he is not aware that
we have already investigated this and published advisories on it.
</p>
<p>
However, I understand that there is also a possibility that he is
falsely claiming that the work is a result of his own research. I don't
mind it since most websites on the web properly attribute the advisory
and the investigation to me and Vipul.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for the alert however. It was interesting to see an old work in
the news recently.

A couple of days ago, I found him again at <a
href="http://attrition.org/">attrition.org</a>, a website that used to
be the largest mirror of defaced websites. Sunny Vaghela has found a
place in its
<a href="http://attrition.org/errata/charlatan/watch_list/">Charlatan
Watch List</a> page. Here is the detailed article on attrition.org that
talks about Sunny Vaghela's claims:
<a href="http://attrition.org/errata/charlatan/watch_list/sunny_vaghela/orkut-claims.html">Sunny Vaghela: Claims of Orkut Vulnerability Research</a>.
He is the third Indian to get into this list after
<a href="http://attrition.org/errata/charlatan/ankit_fadia/">Ankit Fadia</a>
and
<a href="http://attrition.org/errata/charlatan/watch_list/sahil_khan/hackers_and_crackers.html">Sahil Khan</a>.
