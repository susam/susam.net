<!-- title: OSVDB in GSoC -->
<!-- tag: Miscellaneous Humour -->
<p>
  The Open Source Vulnerability Database (OSVDB) is participating in
  Google Summer of Code (GSoC) this year. I have been contributing to
  OSVDB since Aug 2006 and analyzing new vulnerabilities being
  published by security researchers, adding more details to them
  depending on the nature and severity of the vulnerabilities, and
  cataloging them. Our internal systems for cataloging vulnerabilities
  could use some help from more contributors, so it is great that
  OSVDB is participating in GSoC this year.

  Last month we selected some potential contributors from a pile of
  applications. One of them is Timothy F. Tutt Jr. who will be doing
  the Researcher Confidence Project for OSVDB.

  In the commenting system for OSVDB contributors, Brian Martin a.k.a.
  Jericho, one of the project leaders, wrote this comment that I found
  quite funny:

<blockquote>
  Don't think I need to argue how big this is to me, given the time I
  spend arguing with researchers and vendors. If we approve this and I
  am not the mentor, I will feed Jake to a woodchipper.
