Yesterday, I was going through <a
href="https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/09/our-plans-for-code-jam.html">Google's
blog on their plans for Code Jam</a>. I found an error in a document
linked to from their blog post. I wrote an email to inform them about
it. A few hours later, I got an amusing reply from them. Read the
conversation below.

I was going through this PDF file:
<a href="http://services.google.com/blog_resources/Google_CodeJam_Practice.pdf">http://services.google.com/blog_resources/Google_CodeJam_Practice.pdf</a>.
</p>
<p>
Shouldn't the sample output for Problem A be 17 &times; 3 = 51? The sample
output is mentioned as 120 which is incorrect. Please let me
know what you feel.

Susam,
</p>
<p>
If you write the answer in base 6.21110255, I think you'll find that
120 is correct.
</p>
<p>
You're quite right: that was the answer to another example (one that
we did not use).  We will push a fix shortly to the PDF, and we will
have a much more careful review process for actual competitions.

<p>
Thanks for your careful attention,<br>
Bartholomew

Thanks for the quick response.

:-) Or base -8.2111025509. :-P

If you are wondering, how weird the numeral system must be in an
irrational base or negative base, here's a surprise: Donald Knuth has
worked on transcendental base and imaginary base too.
