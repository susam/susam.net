  Yesterday, I was going through
  <a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/09/our-plans-for-code-jam.html">Google's
  blog on their plans for Code Jam</a>.  I found an error in a
  document linked to from their blog post.  I wrote an email to inform
  them about it.  A few hours later, I got an amusing reply from them.
  Read the conversation below.

    <strong>Subject:</strong> Sample output of Problem A probably incorrect
  </p>
  <p>
    I was going through this PDF file:
    <a href="http://services.google.com/blog_resources/Google_CodeJam_Practice.pdf">http://services.google.com/blog_resources/Google_CodeJam_Practice.pdf</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Shouldn't the sample output for Problem A be 17 &times; 3 = 51?
    The sample output is mentioned as 120 which is incorrect.  Please
    let me know what you feel.

    Susam,
  </p>
  <p>
    If you write the answer in base 6.21110255, I think you'll find
    that 120 is correct.
  </p>
  <p>
    You're quite right: that was the answer to another example (one
    that we did not use).  We will push a fix shortly to the PDF, and
    we will have a much more careful review process for actual
    competitions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thanks for your careful attention,<br>
    Bartholomew

  Thanks for the quick response.

  &gt; 120 is correct.

<p>
  :-) Or base -8.2111025509.  :-P

  If you are wondering, how weird the numeral system must be in an
  irrational base or negative base, here's a surprise: Donald Knuth
  has worked on transcendental base and imaginary base too.
