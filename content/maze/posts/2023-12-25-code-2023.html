<!-- title: My Code from 2023 -->
<!-- tag: Programming Technology Retrospective -->
<p>
  In moments of leisure, I find myself immersed in crafting personal
  tools and exploring the joys of computer programming.  Sometimes a
  few of these endeavors evolve into concrete utilities that I feel
  comfortable sharing with others under a free software license.
  Below, I present some highlights and updates from this year's coding
  adventures:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/susam/devil">Devil</a>: This is a
      new Emacs package that intercepts and translates keystrokes to
      provide a modifier-free, non-modal editing experience.  I wrote
      this directly in my <code>~/.emacs</code> several years ago to
      avoid typing key chords.  Instead this tool allowed me to use
      comma (<code>,</code>) as the leader key for invoking key
      sequences involving <kbd>ctrl</kbd> and <kbd>meta</kbd> keys.  I
      kept it private for a long time because I felt that the Emacs
      community may find some of the design decisions and the default
      choices to be outrageous.  However, after extracting it from
      my <code>~/.emacs</code> into a separate package and sharing it
      on <a href="https://melpa.org/#/devil">MELPA</a> (and later
      on <a href="https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/devil.html">NonGNU
      ELPA</a> too), I was pleasantly surprised by the warm and
      supportive feedback I received from many kind and generous
      community members.  In fact, this package received several
      updates this year in order to address such feedback and
      enhancement requests as well as to integrate contributions from
      the community.  This package has evolved a lot and become much
      better, thanks to the small and supportive community that formed
      around it.

    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/susam/cfrs">CFRS[]</a>: This is my
      first contribution to the quirky world of esolangs.  CFRS[] is
      an extremely minimal drawing language consisting of only 6
      simple commands: <code>C</code>,
      <code>F</code>, <code>R</code>, <code>S</code>, <code>[</code>,
      and <code>]</code>.  See the
      file <a href="https://github.com/susam/cfrs/blob/main/demo.md">demo.md</a>
      for a collection of some nice demos submitted by the small
      community around this language.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/susam/fxyt">FXYT</a>: A tiny,
      stack-based, postfix, canvas colouring language with only 36
      simple commands.  This is one of my very recent creations.
      There is not much of a community around it yet.  Nevertheless, I
      find it a lot of fun to play with.  The README file at the
      preceding link has some interesting demos.
    </p>

  <li>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/susam/pcface">PC Face</a>: This is a
      a collection of tools that I wrote early this year to generate
      bitmap arrays for rendering CP437 glyphs using free and open
      source fonts based on the IBM PC OEM fonts.  The bitmaps are
      available in the form of JavaScript arrays and can be used quite
      easily to render glpyhs on an HTML5 Canvas.  Additionally, this
      project offers a few Python and JavaScript functions to create
      similar bitmap arrays from other similar PC fonts and render
      them.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/susam/invaders">Andromeda
      Invaders</a>: I wrote this game last year to fulfill my
      childhood dream of writing my own invaders-style game.  This
      game received several updates this year around text rendering on
      canvas.  In fact, it was the update for rendering text using IBM
      PC OEM fonts that led to the PC Face project mentioned in the
      previous point.  The gameplay has been tweaked too to increase
      the difficulty level.  Further, I wrote an autoplay algorithm
      for fun.  This algorithm automatically moves the player to avoid
      falling boulders and hit the invader ships.  To see the autoplay
      algorithm in action,
      visit <a href="../invaders.html#auto">invaders.html#auto</a>.

  <li>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/susam/nimb">NIMB</a>: NIMB stands
      for NIMB IRC Matrix Bridge.  Yes, a recursive acronym!  ;) This
      is a simple relay client to bridge together different IRC
      channels and Matrix rooms.  Growing dissatisfied with how the
      official bridge from Matrix assumed admin power level in a
      bridged room, removed idle users, etc. I wrote this as a small
      and simple tool for bridging my channels and rooms.  Later when
      Matrix <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2023/11/28/shutting-down-bridge-to-libera-chat/">announced</a>
      that they would shut down their official bridge, it had almost
      no impact on me because I had already switched over from their
      official bridge to this little tool for my bridging needs.
    </p>

  <li>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/susam/clog">Clog</a>: This is a tiny
      IRC chat logger written in Python.  I use it to keep a local
      archive of the chats of some of my favourite IRC channels.  This
      is perhaps my smallest personal tool.  I have shared it at the
      preceding link in case anyone finds it useful but as far as I
      know, I am the only who uses this.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/susam/emacs4cl">Emacs4CL</a>: This
      is an old project that was first released in 2020.  It provides
      a quick-starter-kit to set up Emacs for Common Lisp programming.
      It received a minor update to ensure that it works well with the
      latest version of Paredit.  Apart from that, by popular demand,
      it leaves the menu bar enabled.  Yes, the menu bar used to be
      disabled earlier which later turned out to be misguided.  After
      receiving several suggestions about how the menu bar is
      essential for discovery of new commands relevant to the current
      major mode, the menu bar is enabled now.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/susam/emfy">Emfy</a>: This too is
      another Emacs quick-starter-kit.  However this one is meant to
      set up a general purpose editing and programming environment
      with Emacs.  It was first released in 2021.  It received one
      minor update this year.  The variable
      <code>require-final-newline</code> is now set to <code>t</code>,
      so that files with newlines missing at the end are automatically
      updated with a trailing newline while saving them.  Further, the
      colour scheme of incremental search matches has been updated to
      have more contrast so that the matches are easier to spot and
      navigate through.
    </p>

  As I reflect on this year's coding adventures, I am reminded of the
  beauty of exploration and creativity in coding.  The support and
  feedback I have received from the small yet friendly communities
  around some of these projects has been truly heartening.  Here's to
  another year of solving problems with code, collaboration, and the
  boundless world of possibilities that computer programming offers!
