  I know that Euler's identity is widely regarded as the most
  beautiful theorem in mathematics.  In my opinion, the truly
  beautiful concept involved here is Euler's formula:

  \[
  e^{ix} = \cos x + i \sin x.
  \]

  It unifies algebra, trigonometry, complex numbers, and calculus.
  Euler's identity is only a special case of Euler's formula, i.e.,
  Euler's formula with \( x = \pi \) gives us Euler's identity:

  \[
  e^{i \pi} = -1.
  \]

  This is cute but Euler's formula is truly beautiful.  In fact with
  \( x = \tau = 2\pi, \) we get another cute result:

  \[
  e^{i \tau} = 1.
  \]

  Quoting an excerpt from Chapter 22 of <em>The Feynman Lectures on
  Physics, Volume I</em>:

    We summarize with this, the most remarkable formula in mathematics:

    \[
    e^{i \theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta.
    \]

    This is our jewel.

    We may relate the geometry to the algebra by representing complex
    numbers in a plane; the horizontal position of a point is \( x, \)
    the vertical position of a point is \( y.  \) We represent every
    complex number, \( x + iy.  \) Then if the radial distance to this
    point is called \( r \) and the angle is called \( \theta, \) the
    algebraic law is that \( x + iy \) is written in the form \( r,
    e^{i \theta} \) where the geometrical relationships between \( x
    \) \( y, \) \( r, \) and \( \theta \) are as shown.  This, then,
    is the unification of algebra and geometry.
