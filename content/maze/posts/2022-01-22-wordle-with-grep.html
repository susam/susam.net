<!-- title: Wordle With Grep -->
<!-- tag: Unix Technology Puzzle -->
<p>
  Let us solve a couple
  of <a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/">Wordle</a>
  games with the Unix <code>grep</code> command and the
  Unix <code>words</code> file. The Wordle games #217, #218, and #219
  for 22&nbsp;Jan&nbsp;2022, 23&nbsp;Jan&nbsp;2022, and
  24&nbsp;Jan&nbsp;22, respectively, are used as examples in this
  post. The output examples shown below are obtained using the words
  file <code>/usr/share/dict/words</code>, GNU grep 3.6, and GNU bash
  5.1.4 on Debian GNU/Linux 11.2 (bullseye).
</p>
<p>
  Note that the original Wordle game uses a different word list.
  Further, there are several Wordle clones which may have their own
  word lists. For the purpose of this post, we will use the word list
  that comes with Debian. We will solve each Wordle in a quick and
  dirty manner in this post. The focus is going to be on making
  constant progress and reaching the solution quickly with simple
  shell commands.

<h2 id="preliminary-work">Preliminary Work</h2>
<p>
  Before we start solving Wordle games, we will do some preliminary
  work. We will create a convenient shell alias that automatically
  selects all five-letter words from the <code>words</code> files. We
  will also find a good word to enter as the first guess into the
  Wordle game. The following steps elaborate this preliminary work:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Make a shell alias named <code>words</code> that selects all 5
      letter words from the words file.
    </p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>alias words='grep "^[a-z]\{5\}$" /usr/share/dict/words'</kbd>
$ <kbd>words | head -n 3</kbd>
abaci
aback
abaft
$ <kbd>words | tail -n 3</kbd>
zoned
zones
zooms
$ <kbd>words | wc -l</kbd>
4594</samp>
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      For each letter in the English alphabet, count the number of
      five-letter words that contain the letter. Rank each letter by
      this count.
    </p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>for c in {a..z}; do echo $(words | grep $c | wc -l) $c; done | sort -rn | head -n 15</kbd>
2245 s
2149 e
1736 a
1404 r
1301 o
1231 i
1177 l
1171 t
975 n
924 d
810 u
757 c
708 p
633 h
623 y</samp>
</pre>
    <p>
      The output shows that the letter 's' occurs in 2245 five-letter
      words, followed by 'e' which occurs in 2149 five-letter words,
      and so on.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Find a word that contains the top five letters found in the
      previous step.
    </p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>words | grep s | grep e | grep a | grep r | grep o</kbd>
arose</samp>
</pre>
    <p>
      We will enter this word as the first guess in every Wordle game.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      In case, the word "arose" does not lead to any positive result,
      we will need another word to enter as our second guess. Find a
      word that contains the next five top letters in the list found
      above.
    </p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>words | grep i | grep l | grep t | grep n | grep d</kbd>
$ <kbd>words | grep i | grep l | grep t | grep n | grep u</kbd>
until</samp>
</pre>
    <p>
      We found that there is no such word that contains 'i', 'l', 't',
      'n', and 'd'. So we got rid of 'd' in our search and included
      'u' (the next highest ranking letter after 'd') instead to find
      the word "until". We will enter this word as the second guess if
      and only if the first guess (i.e., "arose") does not lead to any
      positive result.
    </p>
</ol>

<h2 id="wordle-217">Wordle #217</h2>
<p>
  Let us now solve Wordle #217 for Sat,&nbsp;22&nbsp;Jan&nbsp;2022
  with the following steps:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Use the word "arose" as the first guess. The following result
      appears:
    </p>
    <p style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold; color: #ddd">
      <span style="background: #333; padding: 0.5em">A</span>
      <span style="background: #333; padding: 0.5em">R</span>
      <span style="background: #333; padding: 0.5em">O</span>
      <span style="background: #333; padding: 0.5em">S</span>
      <span style="background: #585; padding: 0.5em">E</span>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The previous result shows that the letter 'e' occurs at the
      fifth place. Further, the letters 'a', 'r', 'o', and 's' do not
      occur anywhere in the word. Look for words satisfying these
      constraints.
    </p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>words | grep '....e' | grep -v '[aros]' | head -n 5</kbd>
beige
belie
belle
bible
bilge</samp>
</pre>
    <p>
      Pick the word "beige" for the second guess and enter it into the
      Wordle game. Note that since we are following a quick and dirty
      approach here, we do not spend any time figuring out which of
      the various five-letter words ending with the letter 'e' is the
      most optimal choice for the next guess. We simply pick the first
      word from the output above and enter it as the second guess. The
      following result appears now:
    </p>
    <p style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold; color: #ddd">
      <span style="background: #333; padding: 0.5em">B</span>
      <span style="background: #333; padding: 0.5em">E</span>
      <span style="background: #b93; padding: 0.5em">I</span>
      <span style="background: #333; padding: 0.5em">G</span>
      <span style="background: #585; padding: 0.5em">E</span>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The letter 'i' occurs somewhere in the word but not at the third
      place. Further the letters 'b' and 'g' do not occur anywhere in
      the word. Also, the letter 'e' does not occur anywhere apart
      from the fifth place. The letter 'e' in the gray tile in the
      second place confirms that the letter 'e' does not repeat in the
      answer word. Refine the previous command to add these
      constraints.
    </p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>words | grep '[^e][^e][^ie][^e]e' | grep i | grep -v '[arosbg]' | head -n 5</kbd>
fiche
indue
lithe
mince
niche</samp>
</pre>
    <p>
      Enter "fiche" as the third guess. The following result appears:
    </p>
    <p style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold; color: #ddd">
      <span style="background: #333; padding: 0.5em">F</span>
      <span style="background: #585; padding: 0.5em">I</span>
      <span style="background: #b93; padding: 0.5em">C</span>
      <span style="background: #333; padding: 0.5em">H</span>
      <span style="background: #585; padding: 0.5em">E</span>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The previous result shows that the letter 'i' occurs at the
      second place. Further, the letter 'c' occurs somewhere in the
      word but not at the third place. Also, the letters 'f' and 'h'
      do not occur anywhere in the word. Refine the previous command
      further to add these constraints:
    </p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>words | grep '[^e]i[^iec][^e]e' | grep c | grep -v '[arosbgfh]' | head -n 5</kbd>
mince
wince</samp>
</pre>
    <p>
      Enter the word "mince" for the fourth guess. It leads to the
      following result:
    </p>
    <p style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold; color: #ddd">
      <span style="background: #333; padding: 0.5em">M</span>
      <span style="background: #585; padding: 0.5em">I</span>
      <span style="background: #585; padding: 0.5em">N</span>
      <span style="background: #585; padding: 0.5em">C</span>
      <span style="background: #585; padding: 0.5em">E</span>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      We are almost there! We now have all the letters except the
      first one. The previous result shows that the letter 'm' does
      not occur in the word. Thus the answer word must be "wince". For
      the sake of completeness, here is a refined search that selects
      the answer word based on the constraints known so far:
    </p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>words | grep '[^e]ince' | grep -v '[arosbgfhm]' | head -n 5</kbd>
wince</samp>
</pre>
    <p>
      It looks like we have found the answer word. Enter "wince" as
      the fifth guess to get the following result:
    </p>
    <p style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold; color: #ddd">
      <span style="background: #585; padding: 0.5em">W</span>
      <span style="background: #585; padding: 0.5em">I</span>
      <span style="background: #585; padding: 0.5em">N</span>
      <span style="background: #585; padding: 0.5em">C</span>
      <span style="background: #585; padding: 0.5em">E</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Done!
    </p>
</ol>

<h2 id="wordle-218">Wordle #218</h2>
<p>
  Now that the wordle for Sat,&nbsp;22&nbsp;Jan&nbsp;2022 is solved,
  let us try the same method on Wordle #219 for
  Sun,&nbsp;23&nbsp;Jan&nbsp;2022 and see how well this method works.
  Here are the steps:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Like before, the first guess is "arose". Entering this word
      leads to the following result:
    </p>
    <p style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold; color: #ddd">
      <span style="background: #333; padding: 0.5em">A</span>
      <span style="background: #585; padding: 0.5em">R</span>
      <span style="background: #333; padding: 0.5em">O</span>
      <span style="background: #333; padding: 0.5em">S</span>
      <span style="background: #333; padding: 0.5em">E</span>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Now search for words based on the previous result.
    </p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>words | grep '.r...' | grep -v '[aose]' | head -n 5</kbd>
brick
bring
brink
briny
bruin</samp>
</pre>
    <p>
      Enter the word "brick" as the second guess. This leads to the
      following result:
    </p>
    <p style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold; color: #ddd">
      <span style="background: #333; padding: 0.5em">B</span>
      <span style="background: #585; padding: 0.5em">R</span>
      <span style="background: #585; padding: 0.5em">I</span>
      <span style="background: #b93; padding: 0.5em">C</span>
      <span style="background: #333; padding: 0.5em">K</span>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Use the previous result to refine the search further.
    </p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>words | grep '.ri[^c].' | grep c | grep -v '[aosebk]' | head -n 5</kbd>
crimp</samp>
</pre>
    <p>
      Enter "crimp" as the third guess. This leads to the following result:
    </p>
    <p style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold; color: #ddd">
      <span style="background: #585; padding: 0.5em">C</span>
      <span style="background: #585; padding: 0.5em">R</span>
      <span style="background: #585; padding: 0.5em">I</span>
      <span style="background: #585; padding: 0.5em">M</span>
      <span style="background: #585; padding: 0.5em">P</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Done!
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="wordle-219">Wordle #219</h2>
<p>
  Finally, let us solve Wordle #219 for Mon,&nbsp;24&nbsp;Jan&nbsp;2022.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Enter "arose" as the first guess to get this result:
    </p>
    <p style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold; color: #ddd">
      <span style="background: #333; padding: 0.5em">A</span>
      <span style="background: #333; padding: 0.5em">R</span>
      <span style="background: #585; padding: 0.5em">O</span>
      <span style="background: #333; padding: 0.5em">S</span>
      <span style="background: #333; padding: 0.5em">E</span>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The previous result shows that the third letter is 'o' and the
      letters 'a', 'r', 's', and 'e' do not occur anywhere in the
      word. Search for words that match these constraints.
    </p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>words | grep '..o..' | grep -v '[arse]' | head -n 5</kbd>
block
blond
blood
bloom
blown<samp>
</pre>
    <p>
      Enter "block" as the second guess. This leads to the following
      result:
    </p>
    <p style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold; color: #ddd">
      <span style="background: #333; padding: 0.5em">B</span>
      <span style="background: #b93; padding: 0.5em">L</span>
      <span style="background: #585; padding: 0.5em">O</span>
      <span style="background: #333; padding: 0.5em">C</span>
      <span style="background: #b93; padding: 0.5em">K</span>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The previous result shows that the letter 'l' occurs somewhere
      in the word but not at the second place. Similarly, the letter
      'k' occurs somewhere in the word but not at the fifth place.
      Further, the letters 'b' and 'c' do not occur anywhere in the
      word. Search for words that match these constraints.
    </p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>words | grep '.[^l]o.[^k]' | grep l | grep k | grep -v '[arsebc]' | head -n 5</kbd>
knoll</samp>
</pre>
    <p>
      Enter "knoll" as the third guess. It leads to the following result:
    </p>
    <p style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold; color: #ddd">
      <span style="background: #585; padding: 0.5em">K</span>
      <span style="background: #585; padding: 0.5em">N</span>
      <span style="background: #585; padding: 0.5em">O</span>
      <span style="background: #585; padding: 0.5em">L</span>
      <span style="background: #585; padding: 0.5em">L</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Done!
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
