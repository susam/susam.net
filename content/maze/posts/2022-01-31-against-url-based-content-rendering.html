<!-- title: Against URL-Based Content Rendering -->
<!-- tag: Web Technology -->
<p>
  Today I received a nice pull request to my project
  named <a href="https://github.com/susam/muboard">Muboard</a>. It is
  a shame I am not going to merge this pull request. Muboard is a
  simple web-based tool that can be used as a virtual chalkboard. You
  can type in text with LaTeX snippets in it and Muboard renders your
  input as you type it. Muboard is quite useful to me when I host
  online mathematics book club meetings. Muboard can also be used to
  create distributable self-rendering HTML documents. See the
  preceding link to see demo link, screenshots, usage notes, etc.

<p>
  The <a href="https://github.com/susam/muboard/pull/4">pull
  request</a> I received adds the ability to create a shareable link
  to a Muboard instance. I am hosting mine
  at <a href="https://muboard.net">muboard.net</a>. The shareable link
  encodes the entire content in the URL itself. When someone visits
  the shareable link, it loads Muboard which then looks at the encoded
  content in the URL, and renders the content. It is a nifty idea. An
  idea, I have thought of myself while developing Muboard but then
  decided not to implement. If there is anything that
  running <a href="https://github.com/susam/mathb">MathB.in</a> for
  ten years has taught me, it is that allowing arbitrary users to
  render content that appears on a domain name I have registered is
  going to end up as a huge time sink for me. I would be spending a
  significant portion of my leisure time moderating content, keeping
  regulatory authorities happy, and ensuring that no bad content
  appears on my website. Here is a copy of my complete response on
  this matter from the pull request:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Thank you for the comment and the pull request. The ability to
    share URLs with the content encoded in the URL query parameter or
    fragment identifier has crossed my mind earlier. It is a very
    useful feature indeed. However, I decided against implementing
    such a feature because such features are often abused to display
    spam content or illegitimate content.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now one might wonder why I, as someone who is merely hosting the
    Muboard tool on a website, should care about what kind of content
    one chooses to display on Muboard. After all, the content is
    rendered on the client side, so I am not responsible for the
    content. Unfortunately, the regulatory authorities do not see it
    that way.
  </p>
  <p>
    From my experience of running MathB.in (another project that
    offers a pastebin for mathematics) for the last 10 years, I have
    learnt that as long as such bad content is displayed on a domain
    name I am the registrant of, the regulatory authorities are going
    to contact me and ask me to ensure that such content is not
    displayed on my website. They do not care whether that content is
    rendered on the server side or client side. Further, they usually
    provide only a week's notice. If no measures are taken to prevent
    such content from being rendered on the website, the regulatory
    authorities go ahead and force the cloud provider, hosting
    provider, etc. to take down the website completely.
  </p>
  <p>
    With something like MathB.in which stores the content on the
    server side, I can at least remove the content from its data
    store. However, if the content is rendered entirely on the client
    side on the basis of the encoded content in the URL query
    parameter or fragment identifier, it becomes more difficult to
    know what content is being displayed on the website and block bad
    content from being rendered, say, with some JavaScript code that
    looks for patterns in the content and refuse to render the content
    if it appears to contain bad content. This is not a problem I want
    to solve in Muboard because my prior experience with MathB.in
    shows that it takes considerable time and effort to keep track of
    all possible bad content and to fine tune the patterns to match,
    on a regular basis.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your pull request has a very useful feature and it's a shame I
    cannot add it to the copy of Muboard.net I am running. I do not
    have the time to get involved in maintaining pattern-based content
    blocklisting. If you are really interested in this feature and
    have the risk appetite to allow arbitrary content from users to be
    rendered on your website, I would recommend hosting a clone of
    Muboard.net with this feature on a separate URL that you own. I
    would be happy to link to your clone from the README of this
    project.

  Encoding content in the URL and then rendering that content is fine
  as long as the content is composed from an allowed set of
  tokens. Examples include virtual pianos, online synthesizers, and
  fun games like <a href="https://tixy.land/">Tixy</a>. However, for
  something like Muboard that shows arbitrary text content from users,
  quite unfortunately, I have to decline any pull request that renders
  arbitrary content encoded in the URLs!
