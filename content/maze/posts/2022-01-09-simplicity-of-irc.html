<!-- title: Simplicity of IRC -->
<!-- tag: IRC Networking Protocol Technology Retrospective -->
<p>
  During discussions with my friends and colleagues, whenever the
  topic of chat protocols comes up, I often remark how simple the
  Internet Relay Chat (IRC) protocol is and how this simplicity has
  fostered creativity in the lives of many young computer hobbyists
  growing up in the late 1990s and early 2000s. For many of us who
  were introduced to the Internet during that time, writing an IRC bot
  turned out to be one of our first few non-trivial hobby programming
  projects that involved network sockets, did something meaningful,
  and served actual users.
</p>

<h2 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h2>
<p>
  The underlying payloads that IRC servers and clients exchange during
  an IRC session are quite simple to read manually and understand.
  While implementing IRC servers still involves significant work to
  keep track of users, channels, and exchanging network state and
  messages between servers, implementing IRC clients can often be
  quite simple. With a convenient programming language, one can
  develop all kinds of fun tools and bots pretty quickly. Only
  creativity is the limit!
</p>
<p>
  In the early days of IRC, it was quite common for someone with basic
  programming skills to write a simple IRC bot within a matter of
  hours. Such IRC bots typically responded to requests from users,
  answered frequently asked questions, hosted live quiz contests in a
  channel, etc. The simplicity of the protocol made it very enticing
  to write programs that could talk to IRC servers directly. In fact,
  many people chose to write the code to parse and create IRC payloads
  from scratch. Observing the TCP/IP packets with a packet analyzer
  such as Wireshark or Tcpdump was all one needed to learn about the
  various payload formats.
  Additionally, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1459">RFC
  1459</a> served as a good reference to learn the IRC specification.
</p>
<p>
  As a result of the simplicity of the IRC protocol, sometimes when I
  would find myself needing to join an IRC channel, say to seek some
  technical help, from a system without an IRC client installed, I
  could often just start a <code>telnet</code>, <code>nc</code>,
  or <code>openssl</code> connection directly to my favourite IRC
  network and then type out IRC protocol commands by hand to join the
  channel I need and talk to channel users.
</p>

<h2 id="session">Session</h2>
<p>
  To illustrate how simple the IRC protocol is, here is an example of
  a minimal IRC session that involves joining a channel and posting a
  message:

  In the above session, the user connects to the Libera Chat network
  with the nickname <code>humpty</code>, joins a channel
  named <code>#test</code>, and posts a message.
</p>
<p>
  Note that the above session is not encrypted. By convention, IRC
  port 6667 is used for cleartext connections. A separate port, such
  as port 6697, is available for encrypted connections. Here is an
  example of an encrypted IRC session established with the OpenSSL
  command line tool:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>openssl s_client -quiet -connect irc.libera.chat:6697 2> /dev/null</kbd>
:strontium.libera.chat NOTICE * :*** Checking Ident
:strontium.libera.chat NOTICE * :*** Looking up your hostname...

</pre>
<p>
  The ellipsis denotes lines omitted for the sake of brevity. The
  remainder of the session is quite similar to the first example in
  this post.
</p>
<p>
  It is worth noting here that although the payload format of IRC
  protocol is quite simple, as one starts writing IRC clients, one
  would stumble upon several tiny details about the protocol that
  needs to be taken care of, e.g., authenticating to the network,
  responding to <code>PING</code> messages from the server to avoid
  ping timeouts, splitting messages into shorter messages so that the
  overall payload does not exceed the message length limit of 512
  characters, etc. For a serious IRC client, relying on a suitable
  library that already solves these problems and implements the IRC
  specification accurately is of course going to be useful. But for a
  hobbyist who wants to understand the protocol and write some tools
  for fun, the textual nature of the IRC protocol and its simplicity
  offers a fertile ground for experimentation and creativity.

  In case you have never used IRC but this post has piqued your
  interest and you want to try it out, you probably don't want to be
  typing out IRC payloads by hand. You probably want a good IRC client
  instead. Let me share some convenient ways to connect to the Libera
  Chat network. Say, you want to join the <code>#python</code> channel
  on Libera Chat network. Here are some ways to do it:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Join via web
      interface: <a href="https://web.libera.chat/#python">web.libera.chat/#python</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Join via Matrix
      bridge: <a href="https://app.element.io/#/room/#python:libera.chat">#python:libera.chat</a>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Join using Irssi: On macOS, run <code>brew install irssi</code>
      to install it. On Debian, Ubuntu, or a Debian-based Linux
      system, run <code>sudo apt-get install irssi</code>. Then
      enter <code>irssi -c irc.libera.chat</code> to connect to Libera
      Chat. Then within Irssi, type <code>/join #python</code>.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  There are numerous other ways to join IRC networks. There are GUI
  desktop clients, web browser plugins, Emacs plugins, web-based
  services, bouncers, etc. that let users connect to IRC networks in
  various ways. On Libera Chat, there are various channels for open
  source projects (<code>#emacs</code>, <code>#linux</code>, etc.),
  communities around specific subjects
  (<code>##math</code>, <code>#physics</code>, etc.), programming
  languages
  (<code>#c</code>, <code>#c++</code>, <code>#commonlisp</code>,
  etc.). Type the <code>/join</code> command followed by a space and
  the channel name to join a channel and start posting and reading
  messages there. It is also possible to search for channels by
  channel names. For example, on Libera Chat, to search for all
  channels with "club" in its name, enter the IRC command: <code>/msg
  alis list club</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Although I have used Libera Chat in the examples above, there are
  plenty of other IRC networks too such as EFNet, DALNet, OFTC, etc.
  Libera Chat happens to be one of the very popular and active
  networks for open source projects and topic based communities. I use
  it everyday, so I chose it for the examples here. There are many
  tight-knit communities on Libera Chat. Some of my favourite ones
  are <code>#commonlisp</code>, <code>#emacs</code>, <code>#python</code>,
  etc. All of these have very nice and active communities with great
  attitudes towards beginners.
