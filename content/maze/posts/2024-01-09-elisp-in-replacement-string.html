<!-- title: Elisp in Replacement String -->
<!-- tag: Emacs Lisp -->
<p>
  It is probably well known among Emacs users that the following key
  sequence starts a search-and-replace operation to match strings with
  the regular expression pattern <code>f..</code> and replace the
  matches with <code>bar</code>.
</p>
<pre><code>C-M-% f.. RET bar RET</code></pre>
<p>
  Similarly, the following key sequence looks for strings that match a
  pattern that has two capturing groups and replaces each match with a
  new string that swaps the substrings matched by the capturing
  groups:
</p>
<pre><code>C-M-% \(f..\)-\(b..\) RET \2-\1</code></pre>
<p>
  In the above example, the backreference <code>\1</code> refers to
  the string matched by the first capturing group <code>\(f..\)</code>
  and similarly <code>\2</code> refers to the string matched by the
  second capturing group <code>\(b..\)</code>.  The replacement string
  then swaps the positions of the matches in both capturing groups.
  For example, a string like <code>foo-bar</code> is matched and
  replaced with <code>bar-foo</code>.
</p>
<p>
  What may be less commonly known is the ability to utilise Elisp
  expressions to dynamically compute portions of the replacement
  strings.  To employ this feature, simple write <code>\,</code>
  followed by the Elisp expression in the replacement string.
  Consider the following key sequence:
</p>
<pre><code>C-M-% f.. RET \,(upcase \&) RET</code></pre>
<p>
  The backreference <code>\&</code> refers to the whole match.  We are
  using it as the argument to the Elisp function <code>upcase</code>
  that converts its argument to upper-case.  This example searches for
  strings that match the pattern <code>f..</code> and replaces them
  with the upper-case form of the match.  A string
  like <code>foo-bar</code> is replaced with <code>FOO-bar</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Here is another slightly more sophisticated example:
</p>
<pre><code>C-M-% port-\([0-9]+\) RET port-\,(+ 1000 \#1)</code></pre>
<p>
  The backreference <code>\#1</code> refers to the string matched by
  the first capturing group <code>\([0-9]+\)</code> as
  a <em>number</em>.  The Elisp expression in the replacement pattern
  simply adds <code>1000</code> to that number and replaces the
  matched string with the result.  A string like <code>port-80</code>
  becomes <code>port-1080</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, here is a recent example from the real world of text
  editing where this feature was quite useful to me while solving a
  text editing problem.  Consider the following text buffer with a
  list of numbered items:
</p>
<pre>
<code>### 1) apple
### 2) ball
### 3) bat
### 4) cat
### 5) dog
### 6) elephant
### 7) fish
### 8) grapes
### 9) hen
### 10) ink
### 11) jug
### 12) kite
### 13) lion</code>
</pre>
<p>
  While a toy example has been presented above for the sake of
  simplicity, this example is based on an actual text editing problem
  I encountered recently.  In my actual problem though, there were
  more words in each line and there were some arbitrary paragraphs of
  text between every consecutive pair of items.  Further, the list was
  long with 50 or so items.  The problem now was to remove item number
  3 and renumber all the lines below it.
</p>
<p>
  It is quite straightforward to remove item 3.  Just move the point
  (cursor) to that line and type <code>C-S-&lt;backspace&gt;</code>
  or <code>C-a C-k</code> to kill that line.  We get this:
</p>
<pre>
<code>### 1) apple
### 2) ball
### 4) cat
### 5) dog
### 6) elephant
### 7) fish
### 8) grapes
### 9) hen
### 10) ink
### 11) jug
### 12) kite
### 13) lion</code>
</pre>
<p>
  How do we now renumber all the items starting from <code>4)
  cat</code>?  This is where Elisp expressions in replacement strings
  turn out to be useful.  First move the point to the beginning of
  that line.  Then type the following key sequence:
</p>
<pre><code>C-M-% ^### \([0-9]+\) RET ### \,(1- \#1) RET</code></pre>
<p>
  The search pattern captures the number in each line in a capturing
  group.  The replacement string contains an Elisp expression that
  subtracts one from this number.  Thus a string like <code>###
  4)</code> gets replaced with <code>### 3)</code>.  After completing
  the replacements, we get the following buffer:
</p>
<pre>
<code>### 1) apple
### 2) ball
### 3) cat
### 4) dog
### 5) elephant
### 6) fish
### 7) grapes
### 8) hen
### 9) ink
### 10) jug
### 11) kite
### 12) lion</code>
</pre>
<p>
  I hope this was useful!
