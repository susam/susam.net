<p>
  On <code>#emacs</code> IRC or Matrix channels, we often share
  references to the built-in Emacs documentation as Elisp expressions
  that look like this:
</p>
<pre><code>(info "(emacs) Basic Undo")</code></pre>
<p>
  Here is another example:
</p>
<pre><code>(info "(emacs) Word Search")</code></pre>
<p>
  This is a common practice in the Emacs channels even though all of
  the Emacs manual is available on the world wide web too.  For
  example, the section referred to in the above expression is
  available here:
  <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Word-Search.html">GNU
  Emacs Manual: Word Search</a>.  The reason for sharing Elisp
  expressions like this is likely partly tradition and partly
  convenience.  Many Emacs users are logged into IRC networks via
  Emacs itself, so once the recipient sees an Elisp expression like
  the above one in their chat buffer, visiting the corresponding
  manual page is a simple matter of placing the cursor right after the
  closing parenthesis and typing <code>C-x C-e</code>.
</p>
<p>
  But isn't it clumsy for the sender to type Elisp expressions like
  this merely to share a pointer to a section of a manual with others?
  Turns out, it is not.  This is Emacs!  So of course there are
  key-bindings to do this.

<p>
  Say, while helping another Emacs user we type <code>M-x info-apropos
  RET version control RET</code> and land on the section "Branches"
  and realise that this is the section that the person we are trying
  to help should read.  Now when we are on this section, we can simply
  type <code>c</code> and Emacs will copy the name of the current Info
  node to the kill ring.  This name looks like this:
</p>
<pre><code>(emacs) Branches</code></pre>
<p>
  Now we can go to the <code>*scratch*</code> buffer (or any buffer),
  copy the node name and complete the <code>info</code> expression
  manually.  For example, we could type the following key sequence on
  a fresh new line to create the Elisp expression and copy it to the
  kill ring:
</p>
<pre><code>" " C-b C-y C-a C-SPC C-e M-( info C-a C-k C-/</code></pre>
<p>
  On vanilla Emacs, the above rather long key sequence first types two
  double-quotes next to each other (<code>" "</code>), then moves the
  cursor back to go within the double-quotes (<code>C-b</code>), then
  pastes the text <code>(emacs) Branches</code> from the kill ring
  (<code>C-y</code>), then selects the pasted text (<code>C-a C-SPC
  C-e</code>), then surrounds it within parentheses
  (<code>M-(</code>), then inserts the text <code>info</code> just
  after the opening parentheses and finally copies the resulting
  expression to the kill ring (<code>C-a C-k C-/</code>).  The
  expression copied to the kill ring looks like this:
</p>
<pre><code>(info "(emacs) Branches")</code></pre>
<p>
  Can we avoid constructing the <code>info</code> expression manually
  and have Emacs do it for us?  Turns out we can as we see in the next
  section.

<h2 id="copy-info-expression">Copy Info Expression</h2>
<p>
  I recently learnt from <a href="https://karthinks.com/">Karthink</a>
  and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@mekeor@catgirl.cloud">Mekeor
  Melire</a> that we can ask Emacs to create the
  entire <code>info</code> expression automatically for us.  All we
  need to do is use the zero prefix argument with the <code>c</code>
  key.  So when we are on section "Branches", if we type <code>C-0
  c</code>, the following expression is copied to the kill ring:
</p>
<pre><code>(info "(emacs) Branches")</code></pre>
<p>
  I should have known this because indeed while we are in the Info
  documentation browser, if we type <code>C-h k c</code> to describe
  the key sequence <code>c</code>, we see the following documentation:
</p>
<pre>
<code>c runs the command Info-copy-current-node-name (found in
Info-mode-map), which is an interactive byte-compiled Lisp function in
‘info.el’.

It is bound to c, w, &lt;menu-bar&gt; &lt;info&gt; &lt;Copy Node Name&gt;.

(Info-copy-current-node-name &amp;optional ARG)

Put the name of the current Info node into the kill ring.
The name of the Info file is prepended to the node name in parentheses.
With a zero prefix arg, put the name inside a function call to ‘info’.

  Probably introduced at or before Emacs version 22.1.

</pre>
<p>
  So indeed Emacs has a convenient key sequence to create the
  complete <code>info</code> expression for the current Info node.
  The person who receives this <code>info</code> expression can visit
  the corresponding section of the manual simply by evaluating it.
  For example, after copying the expression in Emacs, they could
  simply type <code>C-y C-x C-e</code> to paste the expression into a
  buffer and evaluate it immediately.  Alternatively, they might want
  to type <code>M-: C-y RET</code> to bring the
  <code>eval-expression</code> minibuffer, paste the expression and
  evaluate it.
