<!-- title: Sticking With MathJax -->
<!-- tag: Web, Technology -->
<p>
  I have considered switching from MathJax to KaTeX for my
  MathJax-based projects such
  as <a href="https://github.com/susam/texme">TeXMe</a>
  and <a href="https://github.com/susam/mathb">MathB</a> but I had to
  decide against doing so because MathJax supports commands
  like <code>\label</code>, <code>\eqref</code>, <code>\notag</code>,
  etc. and environments like <code>align</code>,
  <code>multiline</code>, etc.  KaTeX does not support them, so
  switching to KaTeX would break many existing documents written using
  TeXMe or MathBin.  I am going to stick with MathJax for now.
