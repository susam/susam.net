  I have been using Jira for a very long time now.  I first came
  across it while contributing to Apache projects in 2006.  I find the
  search features of Jira to be remarkably clumsy and inadequate.
  Nevertheless, very recently I learnt to solve a common problem of
  mine.  Let us say, I know a user named <code>alice</code> has
  commented about a specific topic in some Jira ticket.  How do I find
  that ticket?  Here is the search filter for it:
</p>
<pre><code>issueFunction in commented("by alice") and comment ~ "hello"</code></pre>
<p>
  The above example would search all comments by
  user <code>alice</code> that contains the
  string <code>"hello"</code>.  However one limitation of this
  solution is that the <code>issueFunction</code> field is provided by
  ScriptRunner for Jira, so you need this app to be available on your
  Jira for this solution to work.
