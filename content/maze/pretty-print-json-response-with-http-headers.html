<!-- title: Pretty-Printing JSON Response with HTTP Headers -->
<!-- tag: Unix, Shell, Networking, Technology -->
<p>
  Often while using <code>curl</code> with URLs that return a JSON
  response, I need to print the HTTP response headers along with the
  JSON response.  Here is an example that shows how this can be done:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>curl -sSi https://susam.net/code/lab/json/books.json</kbd>
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.18.0
Date: Sat, 05 Apr 2024 11:53:24 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 172
Last-Modified: Sat, 05 Apr 2024 11:53:05 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
ETag: "67f119a1-ac"
Accept-Ranges: bytes

[
  {"title": "Gulliver's Travels", "author": "Jonathan Swift", "published": 1726},
  {"title": "Treasure Island", "author": "Robert Louis Stevenson", "published": 1883}
]</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  The above output is obtained using curl 7.77.0
  (x86_64-apple-darwin21.0).  The <code>-i</code> option is
  responsible for including the HTTP response headers.
  The <code>-s</code> and <code>-S</code> options are not too
  important for the current discussion but I usually happen to use
  them out of habit.  The <code>-s</code> option suppresses the
  progress meter and error messages but the <code>-S</code> re-enables
  the display of error messages.  This helps me avoid the progress
  meter in the output without having to lose visibility of any errors
  that may arise.
</p>
<p>
  So far so good!  But can we also have the JSON response
  pretty-printed with say <code>jq</code>?  The above command prints
  both the HTTP headers and the response to the standard output, so
  piping the standard output to <code>jq</code> does not work.
  The <code>jq</code> command fails with an error as soon as it
  encounters the HTTP headers.
</p>
<p>
  If, however, we manage to send the HTTP header and the response to
  different streams or files, then we could utilise <code>jq</code> to
  pretty-print the stream or file that contains the JSON response.
  Here is an example that shows how to do this:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>curl -sSD head.txt -o out.json https://susam.net/code/lab/json/books.json && cat head.txt && jq . out.json</kbd>
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.18.0

  },
  {

    "author": "Robert Louis Stevenson",
    "published": 1883
  }
]</samp>
</pre>

  Alternatively, we can achieve this using a single command by
  printing the the HTTP headers to standard error.  This ensures that
  only the JSON response is printed to standard output, which we can
  then pretty-print using <code>jq</code>.  Here is an example:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>curl -sSD /dev/stderr https://susam.net/code/lab/json/books.json | jq .</kbd>

  }
]</samp>
