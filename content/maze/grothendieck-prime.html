  Appelé du Néant&mdash;As If Summoned from the Void: The Life of
  Alexandre Grothendieck</a> by Allyn Jackson published in <em>Notices
  of the AMS, Volume 51, Number 10</em>:

<blockquote>
  One striking characteristic of Grothendieck's mode of thinking is
  that it seemed to rely so little on examples.  This can be seen in
  the legend of the so-called "Grothendieck prime".  In a mathematical
  conversation, someone suggested to Grothendieck that they should
  consider a particular prime number.  "You mean an actual number?"
  Grothendieck asked.  The other person replied, yes, an actual prime
  number.  Grothendieck suggested, “All right, take 57.”
