  I think you could improve the UX by putting the success message on

  avoid double submission.

  Maybe add a note to the success message, along the lines of "Yes,
  the comment was actually received by the server. Feels too fast to
  be true? You may have become used to poorly engineered websites
  being <em>really slow</em>." With the last sentence being a link to
  this article.

  Additionally, I'd suggest modifying the form so that the submit
  button goes away after successful submission, because it's <em>so
  tempting</em> to hit it again. (I may be habituated to the bloated
  web too. It's startling to see it not even blink!)

<p>
  Ironically, I was just having a similar conversation with a friend
  earlier that no matter how much our processors are getting faster,
  better GPUs etc., the web and software feels like it keeps getting
  slower. It's almost as if people are just writing worse and
  non-performant code. Some websites turn my laptop into a rocket ship
  because WebGL!

  This is a UX phenomenon that comes up from time to time, and
  sometimes adding an artificial delay does in fact feels better for
  at least some portion of users. Another solution that might help is
  a *very* small bit of JS which receives a 204 response (browsers
  won’t navigate on 204), then clears the form/shows success in situ.
  Sure, it's a *little more* dynamic, and I'm sensitive to adding JS
  unnecessarily (my site currently has none after build), but it would
  be a lot less likely to feel like a false positive. You could even
  add an artificial delay to *displaying* that, as an A/B test just to
  see if it yields fewer duplicates.
</p>
<p>
  Both those suggestions are partly sincere and partly in jest. I
  doubt either of them line up with your goals, mostly posting them in
  case they might benefit other readers. But a fully sincere
  suggestion which I think might be more suitable: display the
  received comment or some truncated portion of it as pending in the
  success response. It's unlikely to add noticeable delay or bloat,
  but it would confirm that the contents of the comment were actually
  received. This isn't a substantial difference in the perceived
  performance, but people have become accustomed to seeing that their
  action had an *effect* (specifically a side-effect).
<p>
<p>
  Feel free, of course, to totally ignore any and all of this advice.
  Thanks for having a site that's fast and lightweight!

</p>
<!-- date: 2022-03-12 23:37:38 +0000 -->

  You could circumvent this issue by replying with something unique to

  IP:xxx.xxx.xxx".

<p>
  Ahh I see the problem now. You also have an interaction design issue
  that makes submitting twice too easy, you leave the form content
  filled.
</p>
<p>
  In a traditional POST form scenario you're moving the user to a new
  page that captures the data and says something like "Comment
  submitted successfully", perhaps with the comment displayed as text.
  In a <em>bloated javascript website</em> it's typical to hide the
  form after submission to remove the temptation. (Don't forget
  oldbies with a propensity to double-click a submit button!)

<p>
  Oh my. Adding to my last comment: I wasn’t expecting to see the
  content of my comment still populated in the form after submitting!
  Whether people are aware of it or not, they may be confused by this.
  Despite the success message (people don’t read), this may feel more
  like the experience of getting validation errors before a submission
  request goes through. Even just making the fields readonly on
  success would probably help with the confusion.

<p>
  Wow, that is fast. I don't think it is just the JavaScript bloated
  web that is confusing people. It is also faster than the animations
  in desktop applications. It makes me wonder, why do OS deliberately
  add so much latency with their animations?
</p>
<!-- date: 2022-03-13 00:34:56 +0000 -->
<!-- name: Somebody1 -->
<p>
  Another thing. When I clicked submit again, the comment didn't
  disappear from the comment box. Text usually disappears when you
  click submit, so that is also probably confusing people.

<p>
  You should make it so that if the same client submits the same
  comment twice in a short period of time with the same message, it
  will disregard it. Or you can say "yes, it was actually submitted
  the first time, don't worry," on multiple attempts?
</p>
<!-- date: 2022-03-13 03:17:25 +0000 -->
<!-- name: A. D. -->

  Maybe place a note for skeptics? In the success message say
  something like "Yes, it was fast, it's not broken!"
</p>
<!-- date: 2022-03-13 03:18:41 +0000 -->
<!-- name: A. D. -->
<p>
  And clear the form after submission! This may be another reason
  people think your form is broken.

</p>
<p>
  I found the return time on the form was not as fast as I expected. I
  have a suspicion your duplicates may be partially due to the UI of
  the form. True: it shows a message saying "comment was submitted
  successfully", but it also leaves the exact same form up, with all
  the content. This is both unusual, in my experience, and I think a
  bit confusing. Why would all content still be available and live for
  editing if the form was really submitted?
</p>
<p>
  I think people probably hit the "Submit Comment" button multiple
  times because they are used to the comment content either
  disappearing after it has been sent, or at least changing
  appearance, so that it is not longer an input form, but now displays
  the un-editable content (thus reflecting that the content has been
  submitted).
</p>
<p>
  I suspect that if you fix this "UI bug", then you'll no longer see
  those duplicates.

  Can you <em>please</em> write a tutorial on how you made this
  website from beginning to end? I know the code is available but a
  tutorial with explanations would be useful. Students can learn from
  it. Your website is one of the best coded websites I have ever come
  across. Hope you can write a how-to guide about it, maybe you could
  even publish it as an ebook or something. I would gladly purchase it
  to learn. Thank you!
