  The nostalgia is well-placed!
</p>
<p>
  I think old technologies never really die out, but rather shift from
  popular use to niche use, and often get more interesting during the
  transition. The pain points of the new and old systems become
  directly comparable and opting in to the old (or parts of it)
  becomes deliberate. This site, for example, is handcrafted on
  purpose, rather than out of necessity (as it would have been on
  early GeoCities), but still has a GitHub.io mirror - the old and the
  new live congenially together.

  And I love it. Thanks for all the joy.
