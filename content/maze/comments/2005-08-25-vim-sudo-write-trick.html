  Wonderful! I could have done with this trick the number of times
  I've been caught out with this one. Noted with thanks.

  20+ years of using Unix and vi, and still learning tricks. Love it!

  The quotes around the percent sign are unnecessary. The
    command <code>:w ! sudo tee %</code> works just fine. I use it
    everytime!

  LP,
</p>
<p>
  Like I explained in my blog post, the quotes around the percent sign
  are necessary to keep the filename as a single argument when the
  filename contains whitespace. If there is no whitespace in the
  filename, then the quotes are not necessary.
</p>
<p>
  Here is an experiment that demonstrates the purpose of quotes:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Enter the following command to create a filename with a space in
      it and then open it with Vim:
    </p>
    <pre><code>sudo touch "foo bar.txt"
vim "foo bar.txt"</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      In Vim, insert some text with the following key sequence:
      <kbd>i</kbd> <kbd>hello</kbd> <kbd>&lt;esc&gt;</kbd>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Now enter the following command in Vim to save the file:
    </p>
    <pre><code>:w !sudo tee %</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      In another instance of the terminal, enter the following command
      to check the content of the file:
    </p>
    <pre><code>cat "foo bar.txt"</code></pre>
    <p>
      The file still appears empty. Nothing was saved to this file.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Now enter the following commands:
    </p>
    <pre><code>cat foo
cat bar.txt</code></pre>
    <p>
      Both files contain the text <code>hello</code> in them.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  This experiment shows that due to the lack of quotes
  around <code>%</code>, the command <code>tee %</code> expands
  to <code>tee foo bar.txt</code> which ends up writing the content of
  the buffer to both files <code>foo</code> and <code>bar.txt</code>
  but not to <code>"foo bar.txt"</code> as we desire.
</p>
<p>
  This is why we need to write <code>tee "%"</code> so that it expands
  to <code>tee "foo bar.txt"</code> and the content of the buffer is
  written to the file named <code>"foo bar.txt"</code>.

  I have often wished there were something equivalent for nano. Of
  course you can just save to another file and <code>sudo mv</code> it
  into place.
</p>
<p>
  In the spirit of this trick, you could set the <code>SPELL</code>
  environment variable to a script that does
</p>
<pre>
<code>#!/bin/sh
read -p "Path: " FILENAME
cat "$1" | sudo tee "$FILENAME"</code>
</pre>
<p>
  and then invoke it with <code>^T</code> from nano. Bonus points:
  Extract the destination filename automatically from <code>ps -p
  $PPID -o command=</code> (somewhat portable) or
  from <code>/proc</code> (Linux).

  RGovostes, Thanks for the interesting idea to make this trick work
  with nano. Based on your comment, I wrote this script to
  automatically detect the destination filename when invoked
  with <code>^T</code> from nano.
</p>
<pre>
<code>#!/bin/sh
set -e
COMMAND=$(ps -p $PPID -o args=)
FILENAME=${COMMAND#*nano }
printf "Write to $FILENAME? (y/n) "
read ANSWER
[ "$ANSWER" = y ] && sudo tee "$FILENAME" < "$1" > /dev/null</code>
</pre>
<p>
  After saving this file to,
  say, <code>/usr/local/bin/sudowrite</code>, it can be set up for
  usage like this:
</p>
<pre>
<code>sudo chmod u+x /usr/local/bin/sudowrite
export SPELL=/usr/local/bin/sudowrite</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Here is how to test it:
</p>
<pre>
<code>sudo touch foo.txt
nano foo.txt</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Now write some text and try to save it by
  typing <kbd>ctrl</kbd>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<kbd>o</kbd> followed
  by <kbd>enter</kbd>. The following error should appear:
</p>
<pre><samp>[ Error writing foo.txt: Permission denied ]</samp></pre>
<p>
  Now type <kbd>ctrl</kbd>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<kbd>t</kbd> followed
  by <kbd>y</kbd> and <kbd>enter</kbd> to save the file successfully
  using the script we wrote above.

  I just
  use <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-eunuch">vim-eunuch</a>
  which includes a <code>:SudoWrite</code> in its list of goodies.
</p>
<p>
  Everything in the plugin is pretty easy to live without but in my
  mind the simple plugin to have everything on-hand is worth it.

  I have got this in my ~/.vimrc now:
</p>
<pre><code>command W w !sudo tee "%" > /dev/null</code></pre>
<!-- date: 2021-12-11 18:35:16 +0000 -->
<!-- name: Mario -->
<p>
  This is a nice tip! I ended up adding this to my ~/.vimrc:
</p>
<pre>
<code>command W execute 'silent write !sudo tee "%" > /dev/null' | edit!</code>
</pre>
<!-- date: 2021-12-12 21:18:58 +0000 -->

<p>
  Thanks for the tip! Adding this to my Vim configuration:
</p>
<pre>
<code>com W exe 'sil w !sudo tee "%" > /dev/null' | e!</code>
</pre>
