  Also, if Yoda were a programmer, I think Forth would be his most
  favourite programming language.  Yoda would say, "A Forth programmer
  I am.  Hrmmm," and he would add two and two with, <code>2 2

  Programming in Lisp or Forth is such fun since you can stretch the
  programming language itself.  For me, the reflective approach keeps
  the fun in programming.
