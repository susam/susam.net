  The missing digit is 4.
</p>
<p>
  There are 25519 combinations of 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 7 and 9
  which are 10-digit multiple of 234.  Interestingly, for the given 9
  digits 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9, no digit other than 4 gives a
  10 digit combination that is multiple of 234.

  Yes, the correct answer is 4.  There are indeed 25519 ten-digit
  multiples of 234 which have 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9 as nine of
  its digits.  The remaining digit must be 4.  We need not brute force
  to confirm this.  It can be proven logically.

<p>
  The number 234 is a multiple of 9.  So any multiple of 234 is also a
  multiple of 9.  We know that the sum of all digits of a multiple of
  9 is a multiple of 9.  If we assume the remaining digit to be \( x,
  \) the sum of the digits of the multiple in question is \( 0 + 1 + 1
  + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 7 + 9 + x = 32 + x.  \) The only value of digit \(
  x \) that makes \( 32 + x \) a multiple of 9 is 4.
