  You can greatly reduce the executable size when compiling with SBCL
  by adding
</p>
<pre><code>:compression t</code></pre>
<p>
  to the following:
</p>
<pre>
<code>(sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die "hello" :executable t :toplevel #'main)</code>
</pre>

  Thank you, Héctor, for your comment!  I updated the example program
  in this post as follows to test the compression feature:
</p>
<pre>
<code>(defun main ()
  (format t "hello, world~%"))
(sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die "hello" :executable t :compression t :toplevel #'main)</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Indeed this created an executable that was only 8.1 MB in size
  whereas without compression the executable size is 35 MB.
