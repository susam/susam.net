<!-- title: Algorithms Channel Migrates to Libera Chat -->
<!-- tag: IRC, Technology -->
<!-- key: xxzcb -->
<p>
  Our <code>##algorithms</code> that has been running on the Freenode
  IRC network for the last 14 years is now migrating to the Libera
  Chat IRC network.  Our new channel name on Libera Chat
  is <code>#algorithms</code>.
</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>
  The original <code>##algorithms</code> channel on Freenode IRC began
  as an offshoot of the <code>##math</code> channel there when we
  found that there was enough interest in the latter to form a channel
  dedicated to the subject of algorithms and data structures.  I
  created the new channel for algorithms in 2007.  I used to go by the
  nick <code>spal</code> and used to be active on both channels.
</p>
<p>
  What began as a tiny hobby group around algorithms gradually grew to
  be be a thriving community with over 200 members.  I don't
  participate in the channel much anymore but a highly talented group
  of moderators helps maintain the channel.

<h2 id="migration">Migration</h2>
<p>
  The original Freenode staff that used to run the Freenode network
  has stepped down after a controversial change in management of
  Freenode.  The former Freenode staff has now launched a new IRC
  network named <em>Libera Chat</em>.  Thousands of channels that used
  to exist on Freenode IRC earlier have been rapidly migrating to
  Libera Chat now.  For more on the events that led to this mass
  migration, see this
  post: <a href="https://gist.github.com/joepie91/df80d8d36cd9d1bde46ba018af497409">The
  Freenode Resignation FAQ</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>##algorithms</code> channel too has now moved from
  Freenode to Libera Chat.  Our new channel name
  is <code>#algorithms</code> on Libera Chat.  Our entire operator team
  for the channel is also moving to the new channel.  The old channel
  on Freenode should now be considered defunct.

<h2 id="join">Join</h2>
<p>
  If you are new to the world of IRC, here are some steps to join the
  Libera Chat network:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Install Irssi, an IRC chat client.  On macOS, enter the following
      command if you have Homebrew:
    </p>
    <pre><code>brew install irssi</code></pre>
    <p>
      On Debian, Ubuntu, or another Debian-based Linux system, enter
      the following command:
    </p>
    <pre><code>sudo apt-get install irssi</code></pre>
    <p>
      For other systems or environments,
      see <a href="https://irssi.org/">irssi.org</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Enter the following command to connect to Libera Chat:
    </p>
    <pre><code>irssi -c irc.libera.chat</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Now type these IRC commands into Irssi to join some channels:
    </p>
    <pre>
<code>/join #algorithms
/join #irssi
/join #libera
/join #linux</code>
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Enter this IRC command into Irssi to send me a message if you
      need any help:
    </p>
    <pre><code>/msg susam hello</code></pre>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  You can also join the algorithms channel via Libera Chat's web
  interface
  at <a href="https://web.libera.chat/#algorithms">web.libera.chat</a>.
  This can be useful for those who want to join the network quickly
  without installing a client.  Further there is a Matrix bridge to the
  channel accessible
  via <a href="https://app.element.io/#/room/#algorithms:libera.chat">#algorithms:libera.chat</a>.
  The Matrix bridge is quite convenient for someone unfamiliar with
  IRC.  For example, you can close your browser or client and your chat
  session will still stay alive on the Matrix bridge.  You can connect
  back the next day and catch up with the messages.  Doing that with
  IRC requires setting up an IRC bouncers which may feel like
  considerable additional work.

  <strong>Update on 15 Jun 2021:</strong> All old communities on the
  Freenode IRC network are now gone.  The new Freenode staff has wiped
  out their database thereby resetting the state of their network.  We
  learnt about this when we received these global notices in our
  clients connected to the Freenode IRC network:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>-root- [Global Notice 1/3] We are moving past legacy freenode to a new
       fork.  The new freenode is launched.  You will slowly be
       disconnected and when you reconnect, you will be on the new
       freenode.  We patiently await to welcome you in freedom's
       holdout - the freenode.

-root- [Global Notice 2/3] If you're looking to connect now, you can
       already /server chat.freenode.net 6697 (ssl) or 6667
       (plaintext).  It's a new genesis for a new era.  Thank you for
       using freenode, and Hello World, from the future.  freenode is
       IRC.  freenode is FOSS.  freenode is freedom.

-root- [Global Notice 3/3] When you connect, register your nickname
       and your channel and get started.  It's a new world.  We're so
       happy to welcome you and the millions of others.  We will be
       posting more information in the coming days on our website and
       twitter.  Otherwise, see you on the other side!</samp>

<p>
  What this really means is that decades old nicks and channels are
  completely wiped out!  For example, my own 15 year old nick is now
  gone.  Our algorithms channel on the Freenode network is also gone.
  All the nicks and other channels I was familiar with are also gone.
  I am not going to bother registering my nick and our channel there
  again!  It is not worth it.  We have all moved on to Libera Chat
  already and there is nothing left on Freenode to care about it
  anymore.
