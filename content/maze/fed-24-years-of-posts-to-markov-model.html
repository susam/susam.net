  Yesterday I shared a little program called the <em>Mark V. Shaney
  Junior</em> at
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/mvs">github.com/susam/mvs</a>.  It
  is a minimal implementation of a Markov text generator inspired by
  the legendary Mark V. Shaney program from the 1980s.  If you don't
  know about Mark V. Shaney, read more about it on the Wikipedia
  article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_V._Shaney">Mark
  V. Shaney</a>.

  It is a very small program that favours simplicity over efficiency.
  As a hobby, I often engage in exploratory programming where I write
  computer programs not to solve a specific problem but simply to
  explore a particular idea or topic for the sole purpose of
  recreation.  I must have written small programs to explore Markov
  chains for various kinds of state spaces over a dozen times by now.
  Every time, I just pick my last experimental code and edit it to
  encode the new state space I am exploring.  That's usually my
  general approach to exploratory programming.  I have hundreds of
  tiny little exploratory programs lying on my disk at any given time.
</p>
<p>
  Once in a while, I get the itch to take one of those exploratory
  programs, give it some finishing touches, wrap it up in a nice Git
  repo along with a <code>README.md</code>, <code>CHANGES.md</code>
  and the whole shebang and share it on
  <a href="https://github.com/susam">github.com/susam</a> and
  <a href="https://codeberg.org/susam">codeberg.org/susam</a>.  The
  Mark V. Shaney Jnr program that I shared yesterday happened to be
  one such exercise.

  If you scroll down the
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/mvs#readme">README</a> of this
  project, you'll find some nice examples of the gibberish this
  program produces.  The first few examples there are a result of
  training the model on <em>A Christmas Carol</em> by Charles Dickens,
  one of my favourite authors.  It is often said that Dickens never
  used fewer words when more would suffice.  So I thought there
  couldn't be a better piece of text when it comes to testing out my
  tiny Markov model.  I'll not reproduce the generated text examples
  here for the sake of brevity.  If you are interested to take a look,
  just head over to
  the <a href="https://github.com/susam/mvs#gibberish-examples">Gibberish
  Examples</a> section of the README.
</p>
<p>
  Soon after sharing the project, I wondered what kind of gibberish it
  would produce if I fed all 24 years of my
  blog <a href="pages.html">posts and pages</a> into the program.
  Well, here's one of the results:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>python3 mvs.py &lt; susam.txt</kbd>
while a query replace operation is approved by the user. The above
variable defines the build job. It can be incredibly useful while
working on assembly language and machine code. In fact, all internal
resources like the result to refine the search prompt changes from
bck-i-search: to fwd-i-search:. Now type C-SPC (i.e. ctrl+space) to
set a mark causes Emacs to use 32-bit registers like EBP, ESP,
etc. Thus the behaviour is undefined. Such code may behave differently
when compiled with the readily available GNU tools like the shape
of 8. Flipping "P" horizontally makes it a proper quine: cat $0</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  Here is another example:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>python3 mvs.py &lt; susam.txt</kbd>
enjoy asking "what happens if" and then type M-x zap-up-to-char RET
b. The buffer for this specific video, the actual fare for 8.3 km and
11 are all written from scratch. No prior knowledge is expected to
slow down in future. For now, I will add a statement like x =
0.999... , the inner corner square as discussed in the code segment
into the REPL window. Unlike Slimv, Vlime can work with and debug
executable files, it can be more convenient. M-x: Execute Extended
Command The key sequence M-q invokes the command cat and type TAB to
indent the</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  Here is a particularly incoherent but amusing one:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>python3 mvs.py &lt; susam.txt</kbd>
Then open a new Lisp source file and the exact answer could harm
students' self-esteem. Scientists have arbitrarily assumed that an
integral domain. However, the string and comment text. To demonstrate
how a build job can trigger itself, pass input to standard output or
standard error), Eshell automatically runs the following command in
Vim and Emacs will copy the message length limit of 512 characters,
etc. For example, while learning to play the game between normal mode
to move the point is on an old dictionary lying around our house and
that is moving to the small and supportive community</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  No, I have never written anywhere that opening a Lisp source file
  could harm anyone's self-esteem.  The text generator has picked up
  the 'Lisp source file' phrase from my
  <a href="lisp-in-vim.html">Lisp in Vim</a> post and the
  'self-esteem' bit from the <a href="from-perl-to-pi.html">From Perl
  to Pi</a> post.
</p>
<p>
  By default, this program looks at trigrams (all sequences of three
  adjacent words) and creates a map where the first two words of the
  trigram are inserted as the key and the third word is appended to
  its list value.  This map is the model.  In this way, the model
  captures each pair of adjacent words along with the words that
  immediately follow each pair.  The text generator then chooses a key
  (a pair of words) at random and looks for a word which follows.  If
  there are multiple followers, it picks one at random.  That is
  pretty much the whole algorithm.  There isn't much more to it.  It
  is as simple as it gets.  For that reason, I often describe a simple
  Markov model like this as the 'hello, world' of language modelling.
</p>
<p>
  The number of words in the key of the map can be set via command
  line arguments.  By default, it is 2 as described above.  This value
  is also known as the order of the model.  So by default the order is
  2.  If we increase it to, say, 3 or 4, the generated text becomes a
  little more coherent.  Here is one such example:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>python3 mvs.py 4 &lt; susam.txt</kbd>
It is also possible to search for channels by channel names. For
example, on Libera Chat, to search for all channels with "python" in
its name, enter the IRC command: /msg alis list python. Although I
have used Libera Chat in the examples above, there are plenty of
infinite fields, so they must all be integral domains too. Consider
the field of rational numbers Q . Another quick way to arrive at this
fact is to observe that when one knight is placed on a type D square,
only two positions for the second knight such that the two knights
</pre>
<p>
  Except for a couple of abrupt transitions, the text is mostly
  coherent.  We need to be careful about not increasing the order too
  much.  In fact, if we increase the order of the model to 5, the
  generated text becomes very dry and factual because it begins to
  quote large portions of the blog posts verbatim.  Not much fun can
  be had like that.
</p>
<p>
  Before I end this post, let me present one final example where I ask
  it to generate text from an initial prompt:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>python3 mvs.py 2 100 'Finally we'</kbd>
Finally we divide this number by a feed aggregrator for Emacs-related
blogs. The following complete key sequences describe the effects of
previous evaluations shall have taken a simple and small to contain
bad content. This provides an interactive byte-compiled Lisp function
in MATLAB and GNU bash 5.1.4 on Debian is easily reproducible in
Windows XP. Older versions might be able to run that server for me it
played a significant burden on me as soon as possible. C-u F: Visit
the marked files or directories in the sense that it was already
initiated and we were to complete the proof.</samp>

<p>
  Apparently, this is how I would sound if I ever took up speaking
  gibberish!
