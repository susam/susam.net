<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>
  We have been reading the book <em>Introduction to Analytic Number
  Theory</em> by Apostol (1976) since March 2021.  It has been going
  consistently since then and the previous few posts on this blog
  provide an account of how this journey has been so far.  After about
  seven months of reading this book together, we are having our final
  meeting for this book today.  This is going to be
  the <a href="cc/iant/log.html#120">120th meeting</a> of our book
  discussion group.  The meeting notes from all previous reading
  sessions are archived at
  <a href="cc/iant/{{ index }}">IANT Notes</a>.  We will discuss the
  final two pages of this book today and complete reading this book.
</p>
<p>
  In the meeting today, we will look at some applications of the
  recursion formula related to partition functions that we learnt
  earlier.  Here is an excerpt from the book that shows a specific
  example that demonstrates the richness and beauty of concepts one
  can discover while studying analytic number theory:
</p>
<blockquote>
  Equation (24) becomes

  \[
  np(n) = \sum_{k=1}^n \sigma(k) p(n - k).
  \]

  a remarkable relation connecting a function of multiplicative number
  theory with one of additive number theory.
</blockquote>
<p>
  Now what equation (24) contains is not important for this post.  Of
  course, you can refer to the book if you really want to know what
  equation (24) is.  We learnt to prove that equation in the
  penultimate meeting for this subject yesterday.  In this post, I
  will emphasise how indeed this equation is remarkable.

<h2 id="divisor-sum-function">The Divisor Sum Function</h2>
<p>
  The divisor sum function \( \sigma(n) \) represents the sum of all
  positive divisors of \( n \).  Here are some examples:

  \begin{align*}
  \sigma(1) &= 1, \\
  \sigma(2) &= 1 + 2 = 3, \\
  \sigma(3) &= 1 + 3 = 4, \\
  \sigma(4) &= 1 + 2 + 4 = 7, \\
  \sigma(5) &= 1 + 5 = 6.
  \end{align*}

  We have spent a good amount of time with this function in the
  initial chapters of the book.  However, for the purpose of this blog
  post, the definition and the examples above are good enough.
</p>
<h2 id="unrestricted-partition-function">The Unrestricted Partition Function</h2>
<p>
  The \( p(n) \) function is the unrestricted partition function.  It
  represents the number of ways \( n \) can be written as a sum of
  positive integers \( \le n \).  Further, we let \( p(0) = 1 \).
  Here are some examples:

  \begin{align*}
  p(1) &= 1, \\
  p(2) &= 2, \\
  p(3) &= 3, \\
  p(4) &= 4, \\
  p(5) &= 7.
  \end{align*}

  Let me illustration the last value.  The integer \( 5 \) can be
  represented as a sum of positive integers \( \le 5 \) in 7 different
  ways.  They are: \( 5 \), \( 4 + 1 \), \( 3 + 2 \), \( 3 + 1 + 1 \),
  \( 2 + 2 + 1 \), \( 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 \), and \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 \).
  Thus \( p(n) = 5 \).
</p>
<h2 id="linkage-of-two-theorems">The Linkage of Two Theories</h2>
<p>
  The divisor sum function comes from multiplicative number theory.
  The partition function comes from additive number theory.  Yet these
  two very different things get linked together in the formula
  mentioned in the excerpt included above.  Here is the formula once
  again:

  \[
    np(n) = \sum_{k=1}^n \sigma(k) p(n - k).
  \]

  How beautiful!  How nicely the divisor sum function and the
  unrestricted partition function appear together elegantly in a
  single equation!  Further, this equation provides a recursion
  formula for the partition function.

  Here is an illustration of this equation with \( n = 5 \):

  \[
    5 \cdot p(5) = 5 \cdot 7 = 35.
  \]

  \begin{align*}
    \sum_{k=1}^5 \sigma(k) p(5 - k)
    &= \sigma(1) p(4) + \sigma(2) p(3) + \sigma(3) p(2) + \sigma(4) p(1) + \sigma(5) p(0) \\
    &= (1)(5) + (3)(3) + (4)(2) + (7)(1) + (6)(1) \\
    &= 5 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 \\
    &= 35.
  \end{align*}

  We will go through this topic once more in the meeting today, so if
  you are interested to see this formula worked out in a step-by-step
  manner, do join our final meeting for this book.

<h2 id="final-meeting">The Final Meeting</h2>
<p>
  The final meeting is coming up at 17:00 UTC today.  Visit
  the <a href="cc/iant/{{ index }}">analytic number theory page</a> to
  get the meeting link.  This is not going to be the final meeting for
  our overall book discussion group though.  This is going to be the
  finally meeting for only the analytic number theory book.  We will
  have more meetings for another book after a short break.
</p>
<p>
  The meeting today is going to be a lightweight session.  The last
  two pages that we will discuss today contain some examples of
  recursion formulas and some commentary about Ramanujan's partition
  identities.  Most of it should make sense even to those who have not
  been part of our meetings earlier, so everyone is welcome to join
  this meeting today, even if only to lurk.  You can also join our
  group by joining our IRC channel where we will publish updates about
  future meetings.  Our channel details are available in the
  <a href="cc/{{ index }}#join">main page here</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="thanks">Thanks!</h2>
<p>
  A big thank you to the Hacker News community and the Libera IRC
  mathematics and algorithms communities who showed interest in these
  meetings, joined the meetings, and made this series of meetings
  successful.
</p>
