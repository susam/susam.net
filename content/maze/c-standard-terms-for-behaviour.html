<p>
  Here are some excerpts from the final drafts of the C99 and C11
  standards <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1256.pdf">n1256.pdf</a>
  and <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1570.pdf">n1570.pdf</a>,
  respectively.

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>§3.4.0: behavior:</strong> external appearance or action
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>§3.4.1: implementation-defined behavior:</strong>
      unspecified behavior where each implementation documents how the
      choice is made.
    </p>
    <p>
      EXAMPLE: An example of implementation-defined behavior is the
      propagation of the high-order bit when a signed integer is
      shifted right.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>§3.4.2: locale-specific behavior:</strong> behavior that
      depends on local conventions of nationality, culture, and
      language that each implementation documents.
    </p>
    <p>
      EXAMPLE: An example of locale-specific behavior is whether the
      <code>islower</code> function returns true for characters other
      than the 26 lowercase Latin letters.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>§3.4.3: undefined behavior:</strong> behavior, upon use
      of a nonportable or erroneous program construct or of erroneous
      data, for which this International Standard imposes no
      requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      NOTE: Possible undefined behavior ranges from ignoring the
      situation completely with unpredictable results, to behaving
      during translation or program execution in a documented manner
      characteristic of the environment (with or without the issuance
      of a diagnostic message), to terminating a translation or
      execution (with the issuance of a diagnostic message).
    </p>
    <p>
      EXAMPLE: An example of undefined behavior is the behavior on
      integer overflow.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>§3.4.4: unspecified behavior:</strong> use of an
      unspecified value, or other behavior where this International
      Standard provides two or more possibilities and imposes no
      further requirements on which is chosen in any instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      EXAMPLE: An example of unspecified behavior is the order in
      which the arguments to a function are evaluated.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
