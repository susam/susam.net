  There is a wonderful story about a legendary Lisp debugging story in
  the <a href="https://gigamonkeys.com/book/lather-rinse-repeat-a-tour-of-the-repl.html">second
  chapter</a> of the book <em>Practical Common Lisp</em> by Peter
  Seibel.  Quoting the story here:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    An even more impressive instance of remote debugging occurred on
    NASA's 1998 Deep Space 1 mission.  A half year after the space
    craft launched, a bit of Lisp code was going to control the
    spacecraft for two days while conducting a sequence of
    experiments.  Unfortunately, a subtle race condition in the code
    had escaped detection during ground testing and was already in
    space.  When the bug manifested in the wild--100 million miles
    away from Earth--the team was able to diagnose and fix the running
    code, allowing the experiments to complete.  One of the
    programmers described it as follows:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Debugging a program running on a $100M piece of hardware that is
      100 million miles away is an interesting experience.  Having a
      read-eval-print loop running on the spacecraft proved invaluable
      in finding and fixing the problem.

  The original source of this story is an article
  called <a href="https://flownet.com/gat/jpl-lisp.html">Lisping at
  JPL</a> written by Ron Garret in 2002.  This story occurs in the
  section called <em>1994-1999 - Remote Agent</em> of the article.
