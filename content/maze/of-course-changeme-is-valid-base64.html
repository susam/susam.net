  Today, I came across
  this <a href="https://3fx.ch/blog/2019/12/09/changeme-is-valid-base64/">blog
  post</a> regarding how the author of the post used the
  string <code>"changeme"</code> as test data while testing a Base64
  decoding functionality in their application.  However, the author
  incorrectly believed that this test data is not a valid
  Base64-encoded string and therefore would fail to decode
  successfully when decoded as Base64.  To their surprise, they found
  that this string <code>"changeme"</code> does in fact decode
  successfully.
</p>
<p>
  The post did not go any further into understanding why
  indeed <code>"changeme"</code> is a valid Base64-encoded string and
  why it can successfully be decoded into binary data.  It appears
  that the author was using Base64 encoding scheme as a black box.
</p>
<p>
  I think it is worth noting and illustrating that any alphanumeric
  string with a length that is a multiple of 4 is a valid
  Base64-encoded string.  Here are some examples that illustrate this:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>printf AAAA | base64 --decode | od -tx1</kbd>
0000000    00  00  00
0000003
$ <kbd>printf AAAAAAAA | base64 --decode | od -tx1</kbd>
0000000    00  00  00  00  00  00
0000006
$ <kbd>printf AQEB | base64 --decode | od -tx1</kbd>
0000000    01  01  01
0000003
$ <kbd>printf AQID | base64 --decode | od -tx1</kbd>
0000000    01  02  03
0000003
$ <kbd>printf main | base64 --decode | od -tx1</kbd>
0000000    99  a8  a7
0000003
$ <kbd>printf scrabble | base64 --decode | od -tx1</kbd>
0000000    b1  ca  da  6d  b9  5e
0000006
$ <kbd>printf 12345678 | base64 --decode | od -tx1</kbd>
0000000    d7  6d  f8  e7  ae  fc
0000006</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  Further, since <code>+</code> and <code>/</code> are also used as
  symbols in Base64 encoding (for binary <code>111110</code>
  and <code>111111</code> respectively), we also have a few more
  interesting examples:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>printf 1+2+3+4+5/11 | base64 --decode | od -tx1</kbd>
0000000    d7  ed  be  df  ee  3e  e7  fd  75
0000011
$ <kbd>printf "\xd7\xed\xbe\xdf\xee\x3e\xe7\xfd\x75" | base64</kbd>
1+2+3+4+5/11</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  I think it is good to understand why any string with a length that
  is a multiple of 4 turns out to be a valid Base64-encoded string.
  The Base64 encoding scheme encodes each group of 6 bits in the
  binary input with a chosen ASCII character.  For every possible
  6-bit binary value, we have assigned an ASCII character that appears
  in the Base64-encoded string.  Each output ASCII character can be
  one of the 64 carefully chosen ASCII characters: lowercase and
  uppercase letters from the English alphabet, the ten digits from the
  Arabic numerals, the plus sign (<code>+</code>) and the forward
  slash (<code>/</code>).  For example, the bits <code>000000</code>
  is encoded as <code>A</code>, the bits <code>000001</code> is
  encoded as <code>B</code> and so on.  The equals sign
  (<code>=</code>) is used for padding but that is not something we
  will discuss in detail in this post.
</p>
<p>
  The smallest positive multiple of 6 that is also a multiple of 8 is
  24.  Thus every group of 3 bytes (24 bits) of binary data is
  translated to 4 ASCII characters in its Base64-encoded string.  Thus
  the entire input data is divided into groups of 3 bytes each and
  then each group of 3 bytes is encoded into 4 ASCII characters.  What
  if the last group is less than 3 bytes long?  There are certain
  padding rules for such cases but I will not discuss them right now
  in this post.  For more details on the padding rules,
  see <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4648">RFC 4648</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Now as a natural result of the encoding scheme, it turns out that
  any 4 alphanumeric characters is a valid Base64 encoding of some
  binary data.  That's because for every alphanumeric character, we
  can find some 6-bit binary data that would be translated to it
  during Base64 encoding.  This is the reason why any alphanumeric
  string with a length that is a multiple of 4 is a valid
  Base64-encoded string and can be successfully decoded to some binary
  data.
