<h1>Susam's Maze</h1>
<p>
  Hello! I am Susam and this is my digital garden. This is a place
  where I archive notes, code, and various miscellaneous files and
  experiments. The name <em>maze</em> refers to the first toy, a
  ball-in-a-maze puzzle, I had received as a four-year-old kid.

<p>
  Maze is a descendant of an intranet server named <code>maze</code>
  that I used to run for my fellow students in our university's
  computer network during my engineering study days back in 2001-2005.
  The server used to host an FTP server and an HTTP portal for
  mathematics puzzles, free software downloads, and audio/video
  streaming. While that intranet portal and its source code written in
  Classic ASP are now long gone, some of its content still survives on
  this website.
