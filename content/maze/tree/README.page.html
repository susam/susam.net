<h1>Susam's Maze</h1>
<p>
  Hello! I am Susam and this is my digital garden. This is a place
  where I archive notes, code, and various miscellaneous files and
  experiments. The name <em>maze</em> refers to the first toy, a
  ball-in-a-maze puzzle, I had received as a four-year-old kid.
</p>
<p>
  This website is a descendant of an intranet server
  named <code>maze</code> that I used to run for my fellow students in
  our university's computer network during my engineering study days
  back in 2001-2005. That server used to host an FTP server and an
  HTTP portal for mathematical puzzles, technical articles, free
  software downloads, and audio/video streaming. While that intranet
  portal and its source code written in Classic ASP are now long gone,
  some of its content still survives on this website.
</p>
<p>
  The current version of this website is generated using a Common Lisp
  program. Every line of HTML and CSS that makes this website is
  handcrafted. The source code is available
  at <a href="https://github.com/susam/susam.net">github.com/susam/susam.net</a>
  in case you want to take a look at it.
