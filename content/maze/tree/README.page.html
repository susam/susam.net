<h1>Susam's Maze</h1>
<p>
  Hello! I am Susam and this is my digital garden. This is a place
  where I archive notes, code, and various miscellaneous files. The
  name <em>maze</em> refers to the first toy, a ball-in-a-maze puzzle,
  I had received as a four-year-old kid.
</p>
<p>
  This digital garden also contains my secondary blog
  named <a href="wall/{{ index }}">wall</a>. It is a relaxed place
  where I do not worry too much about polishing each post. Due to the
  casual nature of this secondary blog, the posts here are less
  thorough than the ones in my primary blog. This allows me to update
  this blog more often. The name <em>wall</em> is inspired by the
  Unix <code>wall</code> command which stands for <em>write to
  all</em>.
</p>
<p>
  Maze is a descendant of an intranet server named <code>maze</code>
  that I used to run for my fellow students in our university's
  computer network during my engineering study days back in 2001-2005.
  The server used to host an FTP server and an HTTP portal for
  mathematics puzzles, free software downloads, and audio/video
  streaming. While that intranet portal and its source code written in
  Classic ASP are now long gone, some of its content still survives on
  this website.
