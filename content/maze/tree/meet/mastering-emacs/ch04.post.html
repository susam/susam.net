  The following notes were taken while discussing Chapter 4 of the
  book <em>Mastering Emacs</em>, 2022 edition (written by Mickey
  Petersen) in

  The following complete key sequences illustrate a few basic
  commands:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>C-x C-f foo.txt RET</code>: Edit file
    named <code>foo.txt</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>C-x C-s</code>: Save current buffer to file.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>C-x b *scratch* RET</code>: Switch to the buffer
    named <code>*scratch*</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>C-x k *scratch* RET</code>: Kill the buffer
    named <code>*scratch*</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>C-x k RET</code>: Kill current buffer.  In fact, like the
    previous key sequence above, typing <code>C-x k</code> first
    prompts for the buffer name.  However, the current buffer name is
    selected as the default value already.  As a result,
    typing <code>RET</code> kills the current buffer.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>C-x C-b</code>: List buffers.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>C-x C-c</code>: Exit Emacs.  This command offers to save all
    unsaved buffers before exiting Emacs.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>ESC ESC ESC</code>: This command exits the current context.
    What that means depends very much on the context.  It performs
    exactly one of the following actions: If there is an active
    region, then it is deactivated; if a minibuffer is open, it gets
    rid of it; if recursive edit is in progress, it quits one level of
    recursive editing; if multiple windows are open, it deletes other
    windows so that the current window becomes the only window in the
    frame.  The aforementioned conditions are tested one by one and as
    soon as one of the conditions is met, the corresponding action is
    executed and the other conditions are skipped.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>C-/</code>: Undo changes.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>F10</code>: Activate the menu bar.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  In my experience, I have found that <code>ESC ESC ESC</code> is most
  useful when a stray minibuffer is open but the cursor is on some
  other buffer instead of the minibuffer and I need to close the
  minibuffer.  Here are some steps that demonstrate this usage:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Type <code>M-x white</code> and pause.  We now have a partially
      typed command in the minibuffer.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Now pretend that we get distracted by some imperfections in the
      text buffer that was open earlier and we want to fix those
      first.  Type <code>C-x o</code> to move away from the minibuffer
      and go back to the text buffer to perform some editing tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this step, we could have typed <code>C-g</code> to quit the
      minibuffer first but we did not do that.  We pretended to get
      distracted by the text buffer and wait straight to it from the
      minibuffer by typing <code>C-x o</code>.  At this point, the
      point is in the text buffer and the minibuffer remains open at
      the bottom.  This can be distracting while performing the text
      editing tasks.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Now type <code>ESC ESC ESC</code> to get rid of the minibuffer
      at the bottom.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
