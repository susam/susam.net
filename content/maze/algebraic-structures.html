  An algebraic structure consists of a nonempty set, a collection of
  operations on the set and a finite set of axioms that the operations
  must satisfy.  This page describes some commonly used algebraic
  structures.

<h2 id="magma">Magma</h2>
<h3 id="magma-definition">Magma Definition</h3>
<p>
  A magma is an ordered pair \( (M, \cdot) \) where \( M \) is a set
  and \( \cdot \) is a binary operation on \( M \).
</p>
<h3 id="magma-closure-property">Magma Closure Property</h3>
<p>
  Some texts explicitly specify the closure property, i.e. for all \(
  a, b \in M \), we must have \( a \cdot b \in M \).  However, stating
  this propery explicity is redundant because a binary operation is
  closed by definition.  A binary operation \( \cdot \) on a set \(
  M \) is defined to be a function

  \[
    \cdot : M \times M \to M; \; (x, y) \mapsto x \cdot y.
  \]

  This definition automatically implies the closure property.  In
  practice, we should always verify that the binary operation defined
  does indeed have the codomain \( M \) to confirm that the closure
  property holds.
</p>
<h3 id="magma-terminology">Magma Terminology</h3>
<p>
  A magma is also known as <em>binar</em>.  The term <em>groupoid</em>
  was used to refer to magma in early texts but this term is also used
  in category theory to refer to a category in which all morphisms are
  invertible.  This term has also been used in early texts to refer to
  a set with a partial binary operation.  Due to the ambiguity
  associated with this term, it is better to use the
  term <em>magma</em> to refer to a set along with its binary
  operation.
</p>
<h3 id="magma-variations">Magma Variations</h3>
<p>
  A magma may satisfy the following additional properties:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Commutativity:</strong> For all \( a, b \in M \), we
      have \( a \cdot b = b \cdot a \).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Identity:</strong> There exists an element \( e \in M \)
      such that for all \( a \in M \), we have \( a \cdot e = a = e
      \cdot a \).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  A magma satisfying the commutativity property is known as
  a <em>commutative magma</em>.  A magma satisfying the identity
  property is known as a <em>unital magma</em>.  A magma satisfying
  both properties is known as <em>commutative unital magma</em>.
</p>
<h2 id="semigroup">Semigroup</h2>
<h3 id="semigroup-axioms">Semigroup Definition</h3>
<p>
  A semigroup is an ordered pair \( (S, \cdot) \) where \( S \) is a
  set and \( \cdot \) is a binary operation on \( M \) satisfying the
  following property:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Associativity:</strong> For all \( a, b, c \in S \), we have
  \( (a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c) \).
</p>
<h3 id="semigroup-closure-property">Semigroup Closure Property</h3>
<p>
  Some texts explicitly specify the closure property, i.e. for all \(
  a, b \in S \), we must have \( a \cdot b \in S \).  However, stating
  this propery explicity is redundant because a binary operation is
  closed by definition.
</p>
<h3 id="semigroup-variations">Semigroup Variations</h3>

  A semigroup may satisfy the following additional properties:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Commutativity:</strong> For all \( a, b \in S \), we
      have \( a \cdot b = b \cdot a \).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Identity:</strong> There exists an element \( e \in S \)
      such that for all \( a \in S \), we have \( a \cdot e = a = e
      \cdot a \).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  A semigroup satisfying the commutativity property is known as
  a <em>commutative semigroup</em> or <em>abelian semigroup</em>.  A
  semigroup satisfying the identity property is known as
  a <em>monoid</em>.  A semigroup satisfying both properties is known
  as a <em>commutative monoid</em>.  Monoid is discussed in detail in
  the next section.
</p>
<h2 id="monoid">Monoid</h2>
<h3 id="monoid-definition">Monoid Definition</h3>
<p>
  A monoid is an ordered pair \( (S, \cdot) \) where \( S \) is a set
  and \( \cdot \) is a binary operation on \( S \) satisfying the
  following properties:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Associativity:</strong> For all \( a, b, c \in S \), we

      such that for all \( a \in S \), we have \( a \cdot e = a = e
      \cdot a \).
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="monoid-closure-property">Monoid Closure Property</h3>
<p>
  Some texts explicitly specify the closure property, i.e. for all \(
  a, b \in S \), we must have \( a \cdot b \in S \).  However, stating
  this propery explicity is redundant because a binary operation is
  closed by definition.
</p>
<h3 id="monoid-variations">Monoid Variations</h3>
<p>
  A monoid may satisfy the following additional property:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Commutativity:</strong> For all \( a, b \in S \), we have \(
  a \cdot b = b \cdot a \).
</p>
<p>
  A monoid satisfying the commutative property is known
  as <em>commutative monoid</em> or, less commonly, <em>abelian
  monoid</em>.
<h2 id="group">Group</h2>
<h3 id="group-axioms">Group Axioms</h3>
<p>
  A group is an ordered pair \( (G, \cdot) \) where \( G \) is a set
  and \( \cdot \) is a binary operation on \( G \) satisfying the
  following properties:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Associativity:</strong> For all \( a, b, c \in G \), we
      have \( (a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c) \).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Identity:</strong> There exists an element \( e \in G \)
      such that for all \( a \in G \), we have \( a \cdot e = a = e
      \cdot a \).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Inverse:</strong> For each \( a \in G \), there exists
      \( a^{-1} \in G \) such that \( a \cdot a^{-1} = e = a^{-1}
      \cdot a \).
    </p>
</ol>
<h3 id="group-closure-property">Group Closure Property</h3>
<p>
  Some texts explicitly specify the closure property, i.e. for all \(
  a, b \in G \), we must have \( a \cdot b \in G \).  However, stating
  this propery explicity is redundant because a binary operation is
  closed by definition.
</p>
<h3 id="group-variations">Group Variations</h3>
<p>
  If a group satisfies the following additional axiom, then it is
  called an <em>abelian group</em>:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Commutativity:</strong> For all \( a, b \in G \), we
      have \( a \cdot b = b \cdot a \).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="group-terminology">Group Terminology</h3>
<p>
  The binary operation \( \cdot \) is called the <em>group
  operation</em> or <em>group law</em>.  The set \( G \) is called
  the <em>underlying set</em> of the group.  The set \( G \) is also
  called a group <em>under</em> the binary operation.
</p>
<h3 id="group-examples">Group Examples</h3>
<p>
  The ordered pair \( (\mathbb{Z}, +) \) forms a group, i.e. the set
  of integers form a group under addition.  In fact, it is an abelian
  group.  However it does not form a group under multiplication, i.e.
  \( (\mathbb{Z}, \cdot) \) does not form a group since there is no
  multiplicative inverse of \( 2 \) in the set of integers.
</p>
<h2 id="ring">Ring</h2>
<h3 id="ring-axioms">Ring Axioms</h3>
<p>
  A ring is a triple \( (R, +, \cdot) \), where \( R \) is a set and
  \( + \) and \( \cdot \) are binary operations on \( R \) called
  addition and multiplication respectively, that satisfies the
  following properties:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Associativity of addition:</strong> For all \( a, b, c
      \in R \), we have \( a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c \).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Commutativity of addition:</strong> For all \( a, b \in
      R \), we have \( a + b = b + a \).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Additive identity:</strong> There exists an element \( 0
      \in R \) such that for all \( a \in R \), we have \( a + 0 = a \).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Additive inverse:</strong> For each \( a \in R \), there
      exists an element \( -a \in R \) such that \( a + (-a) = 0 \).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Associativity of multiplication:</strong> For all \( a,
      b, c \in R \), we have \( a \cdot (b \cdot c) = (a \cdot b)
      \cdot c \).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Left distributivity of multiplication over
      addition:</strong> For all \( a, b, c \in R \), we have \( a
      \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) + (a \cdot c) \).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Right distributivity of multiplication over
      addition:</strong> For all \( a, b, c \in R \), we have \( (b +
      c) \cdot a = (b \cdot a) + (c \cdot a) \).
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  The ring defined in this section is also called <em>noncommutative,
  non-unital ring</em> or <em>noncommutative pseudo-ring</em>
  or <em>rng</em> (i.e. "ring" without "i", signifying the missing
  requirement for multiplicative identity).
</p>
<h3 id="ring-closure-properties">Ring Closure Properties</h3>
<p>
  Some texts include the following additional axioms for the closure
  properties:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Closure under additon:</strong> For all \( a, b \in R \),
      we have \( a + b \in R \).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Closure under multiplication:</strong> For all \( a, b
      \in R \), we have \( a \cdot b \in R \).
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  However many texts omit these two axioms because these axioms are
  already implied by the fact that \( + \) and \( \cdot \) are binary
  operations on \( R \).
</p>

<h3 id="ring-variations">Ring Variations</h3>
<p>
  In addition to the ring axioms defined earlier, a ring may be
  defined to have one or more of the following optional properties:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Multiplicative identity:</strong> There exists an
      element \( 1 \in R \) such that for all \( a \in R \), we have
      \( a \cdot 1 = a = 1 \cdot a \).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Commutativity of multiplication:</strong> For all \( a,
      b \in R \), we have \( a \cdot b = b \cdot a \).
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  A ring satisfying the first property mentioned here is
  called <em>unit ring</em> or <em>unital ring</em> or <em>ring with
  unity</em> or <em>ring with identity</em> or <em>ring with 1</em>.
  A ring satisfying the second property mentioned here is
  called <em>commutative ring</em>.
</p>
<p>
  Many texts define ring to have the multiplicative identity property,
  so such texts mean unit ring when they refer to ring.  Some texts
  define ring to have both the multiplicative identity property and
  the commutative property, so such texts mean commutative unit ring
  when they refer to ring.
</p>
<p>
  Note that when a ring is defined to be commutative, the right
  distributivity property does not need to be explicitly spelled out
  since that is automatically implied by commutativity of
  multiplication.
</p>
<h3 id="ring-examples">Ring Examples</h3>
<p>
  The triple \( (\mathbb{Z}, +, \cdot) \) is an obvious example of a
  ring.  In fact, this is a commutative unit ring.
</p>
<p>
  The triple \( (2\mathbb{Z}, +, \cdot) \) where \( 2\mathbb{Z} \)
  represents the set of all even integers, is a commutative non-unital
  ring.

<h2 id="field">Field</h2>
<h3 id="field-axioms">Field Axioms</h3>
<p>
  A field is a triple \( (F, +, \cdot) \), where \( F \) is a set and
  \( + \) and \( \cdot \) are binary operations on \( F \) called
  addition and multiplication respectively, that satisfies the
  following properties:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Associativity of addition:</strong> For all \( a, b, c

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Additive inverse:</strong> For each \( a \in F \), there
      exists an element \( -a \in F \) such that \( a + (-a) = 0 \).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Associativity of multiplication:</strong> For all \( a,

      \cdot c \).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Commutativity of multiplication:</strong> For all \( a,
      b \in F \), we have \( a \cdot b = b \cdot a \).

      <strong>Multiplicative identity:</strong> There exists an
      element \( 1 \in F \) such that \( 1 \ne 0 \) and for all \( a
      \in F \), we have \( a \cdot 1 = a \).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Multiplicative inverse:</strong> For each \( a \neq 0
      \in F \), there exists an element \( a^{-1} \in F \) such that
      \( a \cdot a^{-1} = 1 \).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Distributivity of multiplication over addition:</strong>
      For all \( a, b, c \in F \), we have \( a \cdot (b + c) = (a
      \cdot b) + (a \cdot c) \).
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="field-closure-properties">Field Closure Properties</h3>
<p>
  Some texts include the following additional axioms for the closure
  properties:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Closure under additon:</strong> For all \( a, b \in F \)
      we have \( a + b \in F \).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Closure under multiplication:</strong> For all \( a, b
      \in F \), we have \( a \cdot b \in F \).
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  However many texts omit these two axioms because these axioms are
  already implied by the fact that \( + \) and \( \cdot \) are binary
  operations on \( F \).
</p>
<h3 id="field-definition-alternatives">Field Definition Alternatives</h3>
<p>
  A field is a triple consisting of a set and two binary operations,
  called addition and multiplication, such that the set is an abelian
  group under addition, the nonzero elements of the set form an
  abelian group under multplication and multiplication distributes
  over addition.
</p>
<p>
  Here, by <em>nonzero elements</em>, we mean the elements that are
  unequal to the additive identity.
</p>
<h3 id="field-examples">Field Examples</h3>
<p>
  The triple \( (\mathbb{Q}, +, \cdot) \) is a field where \(
  \mathbb{Q} \) denotes the set of all rational numbers.  However \(
  \mathbb{Z}, +, \cdot \) is not a field because there is no
  multiplicative inverse of \( 2 \) in the set of integers.
</p>
<p>
  In fact, a field is informally described as a set along with two
  binary operations satisfying properties analogous to those of
  addition and multiplication of rational numbers or real numbers.
