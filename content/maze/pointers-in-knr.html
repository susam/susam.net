<p>
  I learnt C from the book <em>The C Programming Language, 2nd
  ed.</em> (K&amp;R) written by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie
  about 18 years ago during my engineering studies.  The subject of
  pointers was generally believed to be scary among fellow students
  and many of them bought pretty fat books that were dedicated solely
  to the topic of pointers.  However, when I reached Chapter 5 of the
  book , I found that it did a wonderful job at teaching pointers in
  merely 34 pages.  The chapter opens with this sentence:
</p>
<blockquote>
  A pointer is a variable that contains the address of a variable.
</blockquote>
<p>
  The exact point at which the whole topic of pointers became crystal
  clear was when I encountered this sentence in &sect; 5.3 Pointers
  and Arrays:
</p>
<blockquote>
  Rather more surprising, at first sight, is the fact that a reference
  to <code>a[i]</code> can also be written as <code>*(a+i)</code>.
</blockquote>
<p>
  Indeed, it was easy to confirm that by compiling and running the
  following program:
</p>
<pre>
<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    int a[] = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11};
    printf("%d\n", *(a + 2));
    printf("%d\n", a[2]);
    printf("%d\n", 2[a]);
    return 0;
}</code>
</pre>
<p>
  The output is:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>5
5
5</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  C was the first serious programming language I was learning back
  then and at that time, I don't think I could have come across a
  better book than K&amp;R to learn this subject.  Like many others, I
  too feel that this book is a model for technical writing.  I wish
  more technical books were written like this with clear presentation
  and concise treatment.
