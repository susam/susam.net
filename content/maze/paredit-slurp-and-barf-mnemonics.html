<p>
  Of the several sophisticated Paredit commands to edit s-expressions,
  I believe, the following four commands are the most important ones:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>paredit-backward-slurp-sexp</code></li>
  <li><code>paredit-forward-slurp-sexp</code></li>
  <li><code>paredit-backward-barf-sexp</code></li>
  <li><code>paredit-forward-barf-sexp</code></li>
</ul>
<p>
  By default, these commands are bound to the key sequences
  <code>C-(</code>, <code>C-)</code>, <code>C-{</code> and
  <code>C-}</code> respectively in Emacs.  These commands can make
  editing s-expressions very convenient.  However, often on IRC
  networks and other online forums, I come across users who have
  difficulty remembering the key sequence each command is bound to.  I
  will share some mnemonics in this post that make this easier to
  remember.  Before discussing the mnemonics, let us see what these
  commands do.  However, if you already know what these commands do,
  skip right ahead to the
  <em><a href="#mnemonics">Mnemonics</a></em> section.

<h2 id="slurp-demo">Slurp Demo</h2>
<p>
  Say, we have the following Lisp expressions in our editor:
</p>
<pre><code>(* 10 20) (+ 30 40)<span class="cursor"> </span></code></pre>
<p>
  The block above shows where the cursor is placed.  Let us now bring
  the expression <code>(+ 30 40)</code> inside the expression <code>(*
  10 20)</code>.  To do so, we first place the cursor somewhere inside
  the first expression, say, as shown below:
</p>
<pre><code>(* 10 20<span class="cursor">)</span> (+ 30 40)</code></pre>
<p>
  Now type <code>C-)</code> and the closing parenthesis of the first
  expression moves forward to <em>slurp</em> the next expression.  The
  result looks like this:
</p>
<pre><code>(* 10 20<span class="cursor"> </span>(+ 30 40))</code></pre>
<p>
  The key sequence <code>C-)</code> invokes the
  <code>paredit-forward-slurp-sexp</code> command that adds the
  expression following the current list into that list by moving the
  closing delimiter ahead.  Similarly, there is the key sequence
  <code>C-(</code> that invokes the
  <code>paredit-backward-slurp-sexp</code> command which works
  similarly except that it makes the current list consume the
  preceding expression.  Note that the slurp commands expand the
  current list to consume a neighbouring expression.
</p>

<h2 id="barf-demo">Barf Demo</h2>
<p>
  Say, we have the following Lisp expression in our editor:
</p>
<pre><code>(* 10 20 (+ 30 40))<span class="cursor"> </span></code></pre>
<p>
  We now want to move <code>(+ 30 40)</code> out of the first
  expression.  To do so, we first place the cursor somewhere inside
  the outer expression but not inside the inner expression.  Here is
  an example of where we place the cursor:
</p>
<pre><code>(* 10 20 <span class="cursor">(</span>+ 30 40))</code></pre>
<p>
  Now type <code>C-}</code> and the closing parenthesis of the outer
  expression moves behind to <em>barf</em> the inner expression out.
  The result looks like this:
</p>
<pre><code>(* 10 20) <span class="cursor">(</span>+ 30 40)</code></pre>
<p>
  The key sequence <code>C-}</code> invokes the
  <code>paredit-forward-barf-sexp</code> command that removes the
  last expression in the current list from that list by moving the
  closing delimiter behind.  Similarly, there is the key sequence
  <code>C-{</code> that invokes the
  <code>paredit-backward-barf-sexp</code> command which works
  similarly except that it removes the first expression from the
  current list.  Note that the barf commands shrinks the current list
  to remove an expression from that list.
</p>

<h2 id="mnemonics">Mnemonics</h2>
<p>
  When I began using Paredit for the first time, several years ago, I
  could never remember which key sequences <em>slurp</em> and which
  ones <em>barf</em>.  Then I made up these mnemonics:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>C-(</code> and <code>C-)</code> have parentheses that look
    nice and round.  They expand the current list to consume another
    expression.  Nom nom!
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>C-{</code> and <code>C-}</code> have braces that look
    squiggly and wiggly.  They shrink the current list and barf an
    expression.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  I do not need these mnemonics anymore because after using these key
  sequences a few times, they get burnt into our muscle memory.
  However, in the initial days of using Paredit, these mnemonics were
  quite useful.  Now whenever I find someone complaining about how
  easy it is to forget the key sequences bound to these commands, I
  share these mnemonics with them and they never have any problem
  again with the slurp and barf commands.  These mnemonics have served
  me and many others I know quite well.

    <strong>Update on 01 Mar 2022:</strong> Jon Snader, who maintains
    a very popular blog named
    <a href="http://irreal.org/blog/">Irreal</a>, has discussed this
    blog post on his own blog.  While he did not find my mnemonics
    particularly helpful, he has shared his own way of remembering the
    key sequences.  Quoting Jon below:

</p>
<blockquote>
  <em>
    To me, the braces suggest pointing out
    so <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>}</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>{</kbd>
    are clearly for barfing.

    That is quite an interesting and elegant mnemonic.  See his
