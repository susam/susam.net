  While I am browsing the Web, one thing I always like to see is a
  page with purple links.  Since the early days of the Web, purple has
  has become the default colour for visited links.  Here's a relevant
  note from the
  <a href="https://ksi.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/archives/WWW-TALK/www-talk-1993q2.messages/47.html">changelog</a>
  of NCSA Mosaic 0.13 (1993):
</p>
<blockquote>
  Changed default anchor representations: blue and single solid
  underline for unvisited, dark purple and single dashed underline for
  visited.

  Visiting a web page and finding purple links brings a sense of ease.
  The purple links indicate that I am familiar with some of the
  references the web page makes to other articles.  Each purple link
  serves as a small marker of a prior journey, a reminder that I've
  explored certain paths before.  Purple links are like well-worn
  books.  They show signs of use: faded covers, creased spines, and
  dog-eared pages.  Blue links, on the other hand, are like new books,
  still unopened and waiting to be explored.
</p>
<p>
  Although I'm quite fond of purple links, I know that not everyone
  shares this sentiment.  Modern web design trends have moved away
  from this tradition, favouring sleek, minimalist aesthetics where
  visited and unvisisted links look nearly the same, or even using
  custom colours for visited links.  While this can be visually
  appealing, it subtracts from the experience of using the Web as a
  source of knowledge.  When links look indistinguishable or
  unconventional, it can be hard to tell what I've already read,
  especially when I am revisiting a topic and want to easily spot the
  links that are new.
</p>
<p>
  Now it is not hard to change the visited link style with a little
  userscript.  For example the following userscript can override the
  website's stylesheet to colour visited links purple again:
</p>
<pre>
<code>// ==UserScript==
// @name Purple Links
// @match *://*/*
// ==/UserScript==
document.head.appendChild(document.createElement('style'))
document.head.lastElementChild.innerHTML = 'a:visited {color: #518}'</code>
</pre>
<p>
  This little userscript should work well on most web pages with light
  backgrounds.  But if a web page uses a dark theme or a custom colour
  scheme, then the above userscript may need adjustments to either
  handle other colour schemes gracefully.
</p>
<p>
  In the end, sticking with the default purple for visited links isn't
  just about tradition; it is about simplicity and clarity.  It is a
  small but reliable visual cue that makes navigating the Web easier
  and more intuitive, for me, at least.  For me, those purple links
  bring comfort.  They are small reminders of all the digital paths
  I've already walked.  I wish more websites would keep them that way.
  More purple links, please.
