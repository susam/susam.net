<p>
  A quine is a computer program that produces an exact copy of its own
  source code as its output.  It must not consume any input, so tricks
  involving reading its own source code and printing it are not
  permitted.
</p>
<h2 id="classic-quine">The Classic Quine</h2>
<p>
  Here is a classic quine I came across a few days ago in a mailing
  list:
</p>
<pre><code>main(){char*s="main(){char*s=%c%s%c;printf(s,34,s,34);}";printf(s,34,s,34);}</code></pre>
<p>
  This program is written in K&amp;R C.  The current version of GCC
  compiles it fine.  It is a valid quine on ASCII machines because
  this program uses the integer code <code>34</code> to print the
  quotation mark (<code>"</code>) character.  This will be explained
  further in the next section.  On another implementation of the C
  compiler which does not use ASCII code for the quotation mark
  character, the program needs to be modified to the use the correct
  code.
</p>
<p>
  Here are some commands that demonstrate the quine:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>printf '%s' 'main(){char*s="main(){char*s=%c%s%c;printf(s,34,s,34);}";printf(s,34,s,34);}' &gt; quine.c</kbd>
$ <kbd>cc quine.c && ./a.out &gt; out.txt && diff quine.c out.txt</kbd>
$ <kbd>cat quine.c; echo</kbd>
main(){char*s="main(){char*s=%c%s%c;printf(s,34,s,34);}";printf(s,34,s,34);}
$ <kbd>./a.out</kbd>
main(){char*s="main(){char*s=%c%s%c;printf(s,34,s,34);}";printf(s,34,s,34);}</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  The source code of this quine does not end with a newline.
  The <code>-n</code> option of GNU echo ensures that the source code
  file is created without a terminating newline.
</p>
<h2 id="close-look-at-classic-quine">Close Look at the Classic Quine</h2>
<p>
  Let us take a close look at how the quine introduced in the previous
  section works.  Let us add some newlines in the source code of this
  quine for the sake of clarity.
</p>
<pre>
<code>main()
{
    char*s="main(){char*s=%c%s%c;printf(s,34,s,34);}";
    printf(s,34,s,34);
}</code>
</pre>
<p>
  This is almost the same program presented in the previous section.
  Only a few newlines have been added to it to make the program easier
  to read.
</p>
<p>
  We can see that the <code>printf</code> call uses the
  string <code>s</code> as the format string.  The format string
  contains three conversion
  specifications: <code>%c</code>, <code>%s</code>,
  and <code>%c</code>.  The arguments for these conversions
  are: <code>34</code>, the string <code>s</code> itself,
  and <code>34</code> once again.  Note that <code>34</code> is the
  ASCII code for the quotation mark character (<code>"</code>).  With
  that in mind, let us now construct the output of
  the <code>printf</code> call in a step-by-step manner.
</p>
<p>
  The initial portion of the output consists of the format string from
  the beginning up to, but not including, the first conversion
  specification copied unchanged to the output stream.  Here it is:
</p>
<pre><samp>main(){char*s=</samp></pre>
<p>
  Then the first conversion specification <code>%c</code> is
  processed, the corresponnding argument <code>34</code> is taken, and
  a quotation mark is printed like this:
</p>
<pre><samp>"</samp></pre>
<p>
  Then the second conversion specification <code>%s</code> is
  processed.  The corresponding argument is the string <code>s</code>
  itself, so the entire string is printed like this:
</p>
<pre><samp>main(){char*s=%c%s%c;printf(s,34,s,34);}</samp></pre>
<p>
  Then the third conversion specification <code>%c</code> is
  processed.  The corresponding argument is <code>34</code> again, so
  once again a quotation mark is printed like this:
</p>
<pre><samp>"</samp></pre>
<p>
  Finally, the rest of the format string is copied unchanged to
  produce the following output:
</p>
<pre><samp>;printf(s,34,s,34);}</samp></pre>
<p>
  Here are all the five parts of the output presented next to each
  other:
</p>
<pre><samp>main(){char*s=</samp></pre>
<pre><samp>"</samp></pre>
<pre><samp>main(){char*s=%c%s%c;printf(s,34,s,34);}</samp></pre>
<pre><samp>"</samp></pre>
<pre><samp>;printf(s,34,s,34);}</samp></pre>
<p>
  Writing them all out in a single line, we get this:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>main(){char*s="main(){char*s=%c%s%c;printf(s,34,s,34);}";printf(s,34,s,34);}</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  This output matches the source code of the program thus confirming
  that our program is a quine.
</p>
<h2 id="classic-quine-with-terminating-newline">Classic Quine With Terminating Newline</h2>
<p>
  The source code of the classic quine presented above does not
  terminate with a newline.  I found that a little bothersome because
  I am used to always terminating my source code with a single
  trailing newline at the end.  So I decided to modify that quine a
  little to ensure that it always ends with a newline.  This is the
  quine I arrived at:
</p>
<pre><samp>main(){char*s="main(){char*s=%c%s%c;printf(s,34,s,34,10);}%c";printf(s,34,s,34,10);}</samp></pre>
<p>
  Compared to the quine in the previous sections, this one has an
  additional <code>%c</code> at the end of the formal string and the
  integer <code>10</code> as the corresponding argument to ensure that
  the output ends with a newline.  Here is a demonstration of this
  quine:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>echo 'main(){char*s="main(){char*s=%c%s%c;printf(s,34,s,34,10);}%c";printf(s,34,s,34,10);}' &gt; quine.c</kbd>
$ <kbd>cc quine.c && ./a.out &gt; out.txt && diff quine.c out.txt</kbd>
$ <kbd>cat quine.c</kbd>
main(){char*s="main(){char*s=%c%s%c;printf(s,34,s,34,10);}%c";printf(s,34,s,34,10);}
$ <kbd>./a.out</kbd>
main(){char*s="main(){char*s=%c%s%c;printf(s,34,s,34,10);}%c";printf(s,34,s,34,10);}</samp>
</pre>
<h2 id="c89-quine">C89 Quine</h2>
<p>
  The classic C quines presented above are written in K&amp;C.  They
  do not conform to the C standard.  However, with some modifications
  to the quines presented above, we can get a quine that conforms to
  the C89 standard:
</p>
<pre>
<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(){char*s="#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;%cint main(){char*s=%c%s%c;printf(s,10,34,s,34,10);return 0;}%c";printf(s,10,34,s,34,10);return 0;}</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Here is a demonstration of this quine:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>echo '#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(){char*s="#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;%cint main(){char*s=%c%s%c;printf(s,10,34,s,34,10);return 0;}%c";printf(s,10,34,s,34,10);return 0;}' &gt; quine.c</kbd>
$ <kbd>cc -std=c89 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic quine.c && ./a.out &gt; out.txt && diff quine.c out.txt</kbd>
$ <kbd>cat quine.c</kbd>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(){char*s="#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;%cint main(){char*s=%c%s%c;printf(s,10,34,s,34,10);return 0;}%c";printf(s,10,34,s,34,10);return 0;}
$ <kbd>./a.out</kbd>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(){char*s="#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;%cint main(){char*s=%c%s%c;printf(s,10,34,s,34,10);return 0;}%c";printf(s,10,34,s,34,10);return 0;}</samp>
