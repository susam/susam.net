<p>
  The first \( 9 \) natural numbers are given in a list.  You are
  supposed to select two numbers randomly from the list, call them \(
  x \) and \( y \), remove them from the list and insert \( x + y + xy \)
  into the list.  You keep repeating this until you are left with only
  one number in the list.  Find the final number that is left in the
  list.
