  One of my favourite acronyms from the world of computing and
  technology is XINU.  It stands for 'XINU Is Not Unix'.  The
  delightful thing about this acronym is that XINU is also UNIX
  spelled backwards.

  For a given word <em>W</em>, a recursive acronym that both
  negates <em>W</em> and reverses it is possible when <em>W</em> has
  the form <em>W</em> = '?NI?' where each '?' denotes a distinct
  letter.  Some fictitious examples make this clearer:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>LINA Is Not ANIL.</li>
  <li>TINK Is Not KNIT.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Words of the form '?N?' also work if we are happy to contract the
  word 'is' in the acronym.  In fact, in this case we can even obtain
  circular recursive acronyms:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>ANI's Not INA.  INA's Not ANI.</li>
  <li>ONE's Not ENO.  ENO's Not ONE.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  In each pair, the two acronyms negate each other, making them
  circular while also being reverses of one another.  Such acronyms
  could serve as amusing names for expressing friendly banter between
  rival projects.
