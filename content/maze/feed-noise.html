<p>
  Hello!  If you are subscribed to this website's feeds, you may have
  noticed something odd recently.  Your feed reader might have shown a
  bunch of old posts as if they were published today.  If that
  happened with your feed reader, I apologise for the noise.  I hope
  this post will give you some clarity on why this happened.  The
  reason for this noise is a change to the way the RSS feeds are
  generated for this website.  Each post in the feeds includes a GUID,
  which is used by many feed readers to decide whether a post is new
  or if it has been seen already.  Until now, the GUID was simply the
  post's URL, like this:
</p>
<pre>
<code>&lt;url&gt;https://susam.net/product-of-additive-inverses.html&lt;/url&gt;
&lt;guid&gt;https://susam.net/product-of-additive-inverses.html&lt;/guid&gt;</code>
</pre>
<p>
  However, today this has changed to a short unique string, like so:
</p>
<pre>
<code>&lt;url&gt;https://susam.net/product-of-additive-inverses.html&lt;/url&gt;
&lt;guid isPermaLink="false"&gt;rxpnz&lt;/guid&gt;</code>
</pre>
<p>
  If your feed reader looks at this GUID value to decide whether a new
  post has been published, it will show you a whole bunch of old posts
  once again in your reader, as if they were new.  These GUIDs won't
  change again in the future, so this is a one-time problem.  The full
  URL of the post is still present in the feeds, as you can see in the
  example above, so your feed reader still knows where to take you if
  you wish to visit this website to read a post.  The short string
  serves as a unique identifier for each post.

  This website is a passion project I work on in my spare time.
  Sometimes, after publishing a post, I realise the title could be
  sharper or the URL could be cleaner.  I make the necessary changes
  and set up HTTP redirects on my web server, so that visitors using
  the old URL are still taken to the updated location of the post.
  Previously, however, the GUID (being the URL) changed too, which
  caused many feed readers to treat the updated post as a new one even
  when it wasn't.  Switching to stable GUIDs prevents this problem
  from occurring again.  The GUIDs now stay the same no matter what
  changes I make behind the scenes, which means no more unnecessary
  noise in your feed reader.
</p>

  I am sorry if this caused any confusion or clutter.  If your feed
  reader is currently flooded with old posts appearing as new, the
  best solution is to mark those items as read.  Thank you for your
  patience with this issue.  I hope to keep future surprises limited
  to content, not configuration.
