  Hello, Dear Feed Subscribers,
</p>
<p>
  Let me begin by saying thank you for subscribing to the feed of my
  website.  It is a quiet joy of mine to maintain this little corner
  of the Web and occasionally spot, in the server logs, that a few of
  you wander in via your old and trusted feed readers.
</p>
<p>
  Recently, you may have noticed something odd with the feeds from
  this website.  Your feed reader might have shown a bunch of old
  posts as if they were freshly published.  If that happened with your
  feed reader, I apologise for the noise.  I hope this post will give
  you some clarity on why this happened.  The reason for this noise is
  a change to the way the RSS feeds are generated for this website.
  Each post in the feeds includes a GUID, which is used by many feed
  readers to decide whether a post is new or if it has been seen
  already.  Until now, the GUID was simply the post's URL, like this:
</p>
<pre>
<code>&lt;url&gt;https://susam.net/product-of-additive-inverses.html&lt;/url&gt;
&lt;guid&gt;https://susam.net/product-of-additive-inverses.html&lt;/guid&gt;</code>
</pre>
<p>
  However, today this has changed to a randomly generated, permanent
  short URL, like so:
</p>
<pre>
<code>&lt;url&gt;https://susam.net/product-of-additive-inverses.html&lt;/url&gt;
&lt;guid&gt;https://susam.net/p/?cjini&lt;/guid&gt;</code>
</pre>
<p>
  If your feed reader looks at this GUID value to decide whether a new
  post has been published, it would show you a whole bunch of old
  posts once again in your reader, as if they were new.  These GUIDs
  won't change again in the future, so this is a one-time problem
  only.  The full URL of the post is still present in the feeds, as
  you can see in the example above, so your feed reader still knows
  where to take you if you wish to visit this website to read a post.
  The short URL serves only as a unique identifier.  However, if
  someone happens to visit the short URL, it will simply redirect to
  the full URL.
</p>
<p>
  This website is a passion project I work on in my spare time, and
  sometimes, after publishing a post, I realise the title could be
  sharper or the URL could be cleaner.  When I have made such changes
  in the past, the GUID (being the URL) changed too, and your feed
  reader assumed it was seeing a new post.  Switching to stable,
  random GUIDs prevents this problem from occurring again.  The GUIDs
  now stay the same no matter what changes I make behind the scenes,
  which means no more unnecessary noise in your feed reader.
</p>
<p>
  I am sorry if this caused any confusion or clutter.  If your feed
  reader is currently flooded with old posts appearing as new, the
  best solution is to mark those items as read.  That should restore
  order and ensure you only see genuinely new posts going forward.
</p>
<p>
  Thanks for your patience, and for continuing to follow along.  I
  promise to keep future surprises limited to content, not
  configuration.
</p>
<p>
  Cheers,<br>
  Your friendly neighbourhood feed fiddler.
