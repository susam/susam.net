Nice! The syntax on returning function pointers was a little tricky.
Learnt that today! :)

There is a website that you can use for this:
<a href="https://cdecl.org/">https://cdecl.org/</a>.
</p>
<p>
It can take a description like <em>"declare x as pointer to function
(array 10 of pointer to function (pointer to int) returning void)
returning pointer to function (pointer to int) returning void"</em> and
give back its declaration like this:
</p>
<pre>
<code>void (*(*x)(void (*[10])(int *)))(int *)</code>
</pre>

I wrote a simple C parser once, and found this page to be very helpful
in understanding complex C declarators:

See R. P. Mody. 1992. "On understanding type declarations in C."
<em>SIGPLAN Not. 27</em>, 6 (June 1992), 80-83.

It gives a short calculus for understanding pre-ANSI type declarations.
Best quote from it: "We are now ready to tackle a famous horror &mdash;
'signal' of UNIX".
