  Nice!  I like the systematic approach.
</p>
<p>
  The problem occurs if there are many words that differ from the
  target word by only one letter, e.g., bears, fears, gears, pears,
  tears, wears, years - in this case, it would be most useful to
  create a word using as many of those first letters as possible - for
  example, "befit" with b,f,t - so that only one guess is used up to
  find what the first letter is.

  There can be repeated letters!

  Fillon,
</p>
<p>
  I am aware that there can be repeated letters.  In fact, Wordle #219
  ("knoll") does indeed have repeated letters.  However, in Wordle
  #217 we can be sure that there is no repeated letter 'e'.
</p>
<p>
  In Wordle #217, after we enter the word "beige" as the second guess,
  the result has the letter 'e' in a green tile and another occurrence
  of the letter 'e' in a gray tile.  The gray tile containing 'e'
  confirms that there is no repeated letter 'e'.  Here is how the
  second result looks:
</p>
<p style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold; color: #ddd">
  <span style="background: #333; padding: 0.5em">B</span>
  <span style="background: #333; padding: 0.5em">E</span>
  <span style="background: #b93; padding: 0.5em">I</span>
  <span style="background: #333; padding: 0.5em">G</span>
  <span style="background: #585; padding: 0.5em">E</span>
</p>
<p>
  If there were no occurrence of 'e' in an unsolved tile in the result
  above or if there were another 'e' in a yellow tile, then a repeated
  'e' could have been present.  But in the result above, we have
  another 'e' in a gray tile.  This gray tile guarantees that the
  letter 'e' does not repeat in the solution.

  Susam,
</p>
<p>
  Thanks for the explanation.  I did not notice earlier that the
  result has an extra 'e' in a gray tile.  You are right.  Since the
  extra 'e' has been evaluated and marked gray, it cannot occur as a
  repeated letter.
</p>
