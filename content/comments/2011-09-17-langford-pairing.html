  I loved your blog post.  It is the only convincing explanation and
  the best explanation that I could find on the web.  Found a small
  error in the proof of sufficiency.  I think the value of \( c \)
  should be \( 4x - 1 \) and not \( 4x - 3.  \) Great blog post
  though!

<p>
  If I write a blog post about this topic in the near future, I would
  definitely add a link to your post.  Really great work!

  Wonderful post!  I am preparing a video on Langford pairings and
  your proof was incredibly helpful and written in great detail.  Many
  articles come to the necessary condition and just assume sufficiency
  which is wrong.  Yours is the only article that proves both the
  necessity and the sufficiency of the condition.  The construction of
  the sequence in your post is wonderful.

  By the way, I believe there is a small typo in the formula for \( c.
  \) It should be \( c = 4x - 1.  \)

  I found another blog post that references your post:

  Thank you, Ikiatl and Presh, for your comments.  The formula for \(
  c \) indeed had a typo.  Although I wrote the correct values for \(
  c \) obtained from the formula \( c = 4x - 1 \) in the examples, the
  formula itself was written incorrectly as \( c = 4x - 3.  \) I have
  corrected this to \( c = 4x - 1 \) now.  Also, thank you both for
  your kind words about this post!
