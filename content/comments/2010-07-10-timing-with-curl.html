  I do this quite frequently, but use the following Stack Overflow
  post: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/18215389">https://stackoverflow.com/q/18215389</a>.

  This blog post appears to be much of the same, regardless, good
  information to get out there.

  Had no idea curl could do this. If you need a deeper dive, you can
  do something similar with Headless Chrome and the Chrome DevTools
  Protocol.

  There's a good example with
  puppeteer <a href="https://github.com/addyosmani/puppeteer-webperf/blob/2082143/README.md#navigation-timing">here</a>.
  There are other snippets there that you can turn into text command
  line tools too.
