  Thanks for posting this.  It sometimes feels like every web
  developer on the planet is all-in on dark themes, so it's great to
  see someone doing this kind of analysis.  For the record, I've yet
  to see a dark theme that I can view for more than about 60 seconds
  before my vision becomes blurry (see
  <a href="https://boot13.com/firefox/dark-mode-rant/">boot13.com/firefox/dark-mode-rant/</a>).
  I encourage developers to provide light theme options, but I also
  use tools like Tranquility when that's not available.
