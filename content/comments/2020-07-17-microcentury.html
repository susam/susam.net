  If we consider optimal attention span, a microcentury is much too
  long.  Two half microcenturies with a pause in between would be
  better.

  I like this analysis a lot!  But there's one more twist to the
  story: are we even using the right definition of year?  There's
  actually several different ways we can define a year:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    NIST-811 defines the light-year "year" as 365.2500 days and the
    "common year" as 365 days exactly.
  </li>
  <li>
    The sidereal year: the time it takes for the stars to return to a
    fixed point.  That's 365.2563 days.
  </li>
  <li>
    The tropical year: the time between vernal equinoxes.  That's
    365.2421 days.
  </li>
  <li>
    The anomalistic year: the time between points where the earth is
    closest to the sun.  That's 365.2596 days.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  For each of these we can define the microcentury as a hundred
  microyears.  So the sidereal microcentury is +35.81 seconds, while
  the tropical microcentury is +35.69 seconds.  The NIST microcentury
  is +33.6 seconds, while the Julian microcentury is +35.76 seconds
  (as you calculated).
</p>
<p>
  Personally, I'd define a calendar microcentury as a four-millionth
  of 400 years to match the leap year cycle.  That'd give us +35.692
  seconds.

  We had a running joke in engineering school, that &pi; seconds is
  close to a nanocentury by around 6 nanomonths, we obviously didn't
  go that far in calculations, so I wonder if it still holds.

  Running overtime is the one unforgivable error a lecturer can make.

<p>
  This is tangential to the content of the article but I'm continually
  astonished by the number of speakers who seem to be comfortable
  (largely at conferences) running over time cutting into their
  question time, the time of the next speaker, or even worse, lunch!
  Presumably it's not just me and Rota who feel this way, but it seems
  like there must be a large contingent of people who are very
  easygoing about it and quite happy to overrun or listen to
  overrunning speakers.  I would be interested to know the thoughts of
  other readers.

  Elon Musk says he is willing to spend $6 billion to fight world
  hunger if all hungry people relocate to Mars.  So it could be good
  idea to calculate how long one milionth of a century on Mars is!

  Tome,
</p>
<p>
  At most conferences, the people speaking are not professional
  speakers, and as such I don’t mind them running over.
</p>
<p>
  In my experience, it’s hard to time a talk correctly, even with
  multiple run throughs ahead of time.  Standing up in front of a big
  crowd, even if I’ve got a stop watch running I can end up going far
  too quick, or far too slowly, and end up with tunnel vision where I
  fail to identify and correct the mistake.
</p>
<p>
  Are <em>some</em> of the speakers doing it intentionally?  Probably.
  Did some just fail to prepare?  Almost certainly.  But things come
  up, and in the most charitable case, they just stood in front of a
  bunch of people and communicated something they thought was
  important.  I applaud them for that, and move on.

  I usually don't like it when people sidestep the content of a link,
  to go on some tangent about its typography or aesthetics.
  But <em>damn</em>.  This is a gorgeous looking blog, for using only
  default fonts and minimal CSS.
</p>
<p>
  Apparently the author wrote his
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/susam.net/blob/283042d/site.lisp">own
  static site builder in Common Lisp</a>, but it's <em>so</em> minimal
  that the content itself is still written in raw HTML.  It feels
  silly but this just takes me back to happier days (pre-WordPress and
  pre-social media) and makes me wonder why we lost our way.  I dearly
  miss the feeling of making sites like this (but uglier!)  back in
  the 1990's.  Applause.

  FemmeAndroid,
</p>
<p>
  So true!  I always rehearse my talks several times with the
  stopwatch on my phone sitting on a nearby desk, but I feel like
  that’s not an obvious thing to people who are getting started and
  don’t have theatre or public speaking experience.
</p>
<p>
  It's a lot like that quote, "If I had more time I would’ve written a
  shorter letter."

  FemmeAndroid,

  I've always thought that conference talks should have the traffic
  light system that you get a Toastmasters.
</p>
<p>
  IIRC it's green while you've still got plenty of time, orange when
  you're within x minutes of the scheduled end, and red once you're at
  the scheduled end.
</p>
<p>
  I've found from Toastmasters that a nice bright light at the back of
  the hall is much easier to respond to than a clock or something
  counting down.
