  I remember reading that the creator of the original ping command
  said he was still slightly annoyed decades after that he didn't also
  invent traceroute at the same time.

  I love snippets like this because they're so useful for teaching.
  Suits the "Socratic/inductive" method of saying "Oh, if only we had
  a tool that does this kind of route tracing ...  Oh wait a minute
  ...  Hmm what's traceroute do?"

<p>
  They also demonstrate the Unix philosophy that more complex tools
  can be built from smaller ones.

  I glad to see this.  I sometimes use this to troubleshoot on remote
  systems with no <code>traceroute</code> available.
