IMHO a very well-written article with great attention to detail. I
especially liked the section on paredit with its step-by-step
explanation.

I wonder why the author doesn't mention the plugin <a
href="https://github.com/jpalardy/vim-slime">vim-slime</a>, given that
it seems to be more popular than either Slimv or Vlime on GitHub. From
what I can gather, Slimv and Vlime are more focused on Lisp with
built-in completion and debugging whereas vim-slime is language agnostic
and simply recreates just the "connected REPL" behavior of Slime.

The "vim-slime" plugin is not appropriate for my blog post because it is
nothing like SLIME. In fact, the word "slime" in "vim-slime" is poorly
chosen. It supports none of the SLIME features. It does not even provide
the "connected REPL" experience like SLIME, Slimv, or Vlime does. Here
are the major reasons why vim-slime is very limited and insufficient as
a Lisp development environment when compared to SLIME, Slimv, or Vlime:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    It does not understand s-expressions. It can only send the current
    text paragraph or text selected in visual mode to a terminal running
    in GNU Screen, tmux, Neovim, etc. Therefore, it cannot send, say,
    only the current expression or an entire function definition or a
    top-level form to the terminal.
  </li>
  <li>
    Since it is language-agnostic and really only sends text from a
    buffer to a terminal, it does not care whether the text is code or
    prose. It also does not care if the terminal is running a Unix shell
    or a REPL. It is the user's responsibility to ensure that the
    correct REPL is running on the terminal and the corresponding code
    is being sent from Vim using vim-slime.
  </li>
  <li>
    Since it does not implement the client-server architecture that
    SLIME and Swank implement together, it has none of the interactive
    debugging features of SLIME. It cannot automatically launch the
    integrated Slime Debugger (SLDB) when an unhandled condition occurs.
    As a result, all debugging features like inspecting code, inspecting
    variables, etc. are missing.
  </li>
  <li>
    Almost all of the SLIME features are missing from it. It does not
    support displaying argument lists as we type function calls, Common
    Lisp HyperSpec (CLHS) lookup and completion, describing symbols,
    cross-referencing, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    It does not provide any key-bindings for common tasks such as macro
    expansion, function tracing, etc.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
Swank server is an integral component of SLIME. It is essential to the
way SLIME works. A plugin that does not talk to Swank server can hardly
be anything like SLIME. Slimv and Vlime on the other hand talk to the
same Swank server that SLIME talks to. Slimv and Vlime are
re-implementations of the client component of SLIME. They send SLIME
commands to Swank just like SLIME does. As a result, Slimv and Vlime are
able to support a good portion of the features available in SLIME.

I think this was a possible typo in the comparison table:
</p>
<blockquote>
The buffer for REPL is not interactive in Slimv.
</blockquote>
I think this was meant to be:
<blockquote>
The buffer for REPL is not interactive in Vlime.

Thank you, John, for reporting the error in the comparison table. That
was indeed a typo. I have fixed it now.
