  In French, we use the long scale almost as is.  We
  have <em>milliard</em>, <em>trilliard</em>, etc.
</p>
<p>
  We always have to convert the English's billion to French's
  milliard, and so on.  Yet, we haven't learned the rule for the
  "scale", since there's none for the long scale's <em>-iard</em>
  numbers.  Each multiple-of-3 power of 10 has a name and that's it.

  In Spanish speaking countries, a billion is a million millions.
</p>
<p>
  The problem is that sometimes, when translating news or articles
  from English, they do it literally, so an English billion (one
  thousand millions) is put in Spanish as a "billón" (a million
  millions).  That is a source of mistaken amounts.

  I'm from Denmark were we use the long scale.  I didn't know a long
  scale form existed in English!  It happens quite often that a
  billion, in English, gets translated to a billion in Danish, which
  is off by \( 999 \times 10^9 \), and of course, should have been a
  milliard.  ;-)

  I grew up with the long scale (in Poland), so I may biased, but I
  find \( 10^{6n} \) more intuitive and easier to use than the short
  scale's \( 10^{3n+3} \) (with \( n \) being the Latin prefix).  It's
  mentally easier to divide the exponent by 6 than to subtract 3 and
  divide by 3.
</p>
<p>
  Also, the long scale covers more orders of magnitude, and between
  each \( n \)-illion and \( (n+1) \)-illion there is a \( 10^{6n+3}
  \) \( n \)-illiard (\( 10^9 \) = "milliard", \( 10^{15} \) =
  "billiard" and so on), so one doesn't need to operate with
  "thousands of -illions".
</p>
<p>
  Said that, I still prefer the scientific notation \( k × 10^n \) to
  names of large numbers, precisely because both scales co-exist, and
  lead to mistakes literally off by multiple orders of magnitude.
