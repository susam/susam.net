  In French, we use the long scale almost as is.  We
  have <em>milliard</em>, <em>trilliard</em>, etc.
</p>
<p>
  We always have to convert the English's billion to French's
  milliard, and so on.  Yet, we haven't learned the rule for the
  "scale", since there's none for the long scale's <em>-iard</em>
  numbers.  Each multiple-of-3 power of 10 has a name and that's it.

  In Spanish speaking countries, a billion is a million millions.
</p>
<p>
  The problem is that sometimes, when translating news or articles
  from English, they do it literally, so an English billion (one
  thousand millions) is put in Spanish as a "billón" (a million
  millions).  That is a source of mistaken amounts.

  I'm from Denmark were we use the long scale.  I didn't know a long
  scale form existed in English!  It happens quite often that a
  billion, in English, gets translated to a billion in Danish, which
  is off by \( 999 \times 10^9 \), and of course, should have been a
  milliard.  ;-)
