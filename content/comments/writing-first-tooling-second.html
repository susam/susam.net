  That's the exact thought I started my website with.  To add to what
  you said, using an LLM gives a good RoI since you get a minimal
  scaffolding in minutes and then you can really focus on writing.

  My website is a collection of 7,000 or so structured Markdown files
  "sort of" indexed by SQLite.  I've been incrementally fiddling with
  it for eight years, and it's my absolute favorite pastime.  Nothing
  makes me happier than tinkering with it.
