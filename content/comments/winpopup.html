  When I was in high school, we abused <code>net send</code> and
  managed to blast a "all your base are belong to us" message to every
  PC on campus.
</p>
<p>
  We suspected it even reached other schools in the district.
</p>
<p>
  Good times.

  Vyrotek,

  Similar story.  I was in the 10th grade, and we had a teacher who,
  in study hall, would make us all watch a projector of her monitor
  just reading awful PowerPoint slides about whatever topic she was
  interested in.  I wanted to do my homework in that period since I
  never did homework at home, but she wouldn't allow it.  Other people
  wanted to quietly socialize but could not.  Everyone hated it.
</p>
<p>
  So on one of the computers in the back of the room, I used Windows
  Task Scheduler to do something akin to <code>net send
  room-6a-teacher COMPUTER MUST BE REBOOTED IMMEDIATELY</code> every 5
  minutes for the duration of the class.  The teacher was not very
  tech savvy.  She once claimed to have deleted regedit, because it
  looked like a Rubik's Cube and she did not want games on her
  computer.  She never ended up figuring out why her computer messed
  up during our class but it let us have our study hall back as our
  own.
</p>
<p>
  In the 12th grade I told my computer networking teacher that story
  and he said he knew exactly what was happening but not who did or
  why they did, so he did not want to stick his nose in to a study
  hall.  He said, "I should have figured it was you".  I took it as a
  compliment of the highest order.
