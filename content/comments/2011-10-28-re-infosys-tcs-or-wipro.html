  +1 for standing by your opinion and the truth.

  I completely agree with your first blog post and this one too.  This
  and the previous blog post completely relates to me.  After
  finishing my engineering studies, I did not join TCS (by luck
  because of recession).  I know many friends who did and were later
  not happy working there.  My friends in TCS and Infosys want to quit
  these companies as soon as possible.
</p>
<p>
  I joined a product startup and learnt enormous engineering problems
  and solutions.  After that experience I have decided that I will
  join only product companies.  Now, I am working with another
  startup.
</p>
<p>
  I've also had debates with my friends who give similar kind of
  arguments.
</p>
<p>
  +1 from me for writing this blog post.

  Susam,
</p>
<p>
  I am really surprised to see your honest introspection for a post
  written months back.  I see a difference in perspective between then
  and now.  Do you really see an engineering challenge in working for
  one of the big houses which you vouched for?  I will wait for your
  answer.
</p>
<p>
  You are able to write this because a handful of Indians merely a
  couple of decades back thought of doing something which gave path to
  millions of people like me, an average guy.  Drive to engineering
  excellence is not an only driving factor.  We have come a long way
  and I am able to say this because once in my career I was part of a
  darling of silicon valley startup and to your surprise that picture
  is no more on the technology map.  That shop is shut irrespective of
  all their cutting edge engineering solutions.
</p>
<p>
  Please do not take me in a league where you see me denying the fact
  which you have already talked about from rooftop.  I am not
  advocating anything but I have a question for you.  How many
  institutions are here in our country which produce quality
  engineers?  I guess you are counting on your fingers.  Where do you
  see an average engineer like me who all his life memorized some
  notes and was busy living others' dream?

  Hi Vijay,
</p>
<p>
  You asked me,
</p>
<blockquote>
  Do you really see an engineering challenge in working for one of the
  BIG houses which you vouched for?  I will wait for your answer.
</blockquote>
<p>
  Yes, I do.  I have expressed my views about this in the 4th point of
  my post.
</p>
<p>
  I agree with other things you have written in your comment.  This
  post is only about an individual's pursuit for excellence in
  engineering.  Yes, it is not the only important factor in life.
  There are many other factors in life and career which are important.
  This post is neutral about such factors.  This post neither speaks
  in favour of nor against such other factors.
</p>
<p>
  You also asked,
</p>
<blockquote>
  Where do you see an average engineers like me who all his life
  memorized some notes and was busy living others' dream?
</blockquote>
<p>
  I've expressed my views about this in the 6th point of my post.

  I was one of those who slammed your previous post.  I honestly
  thought it did not help in calling a spade a spade.  But I've learnt
  a few things since then and you have too.  The biggest thing I see
  is the confidence you get by working in a place that gives you hard
  problems to solve, not software abstractions, just hard problems.
</p>
<p>
  I know a few really smart engineers who feel they are average in
  Google.  You can't guess how your job will turn out.  A startup
  might drain you and a big IT company might not be able to meet your
  aspirations.  I believe that if you feel average in your workplace,
  then you are in the correct place.
</p>
<p>
  Startups by nature have low politics.  They provide decent money,
  perks, holidays, and everything.  It's a different kind of
  lifestyle.  But there is noise in the quality of problems that
  startups solve.  Before joining a startup, evaluate the problems it
  solves.  Don't do it to be cool.  Do it to become cool.

  Apart from the purely technical part of engineering and career
  potential, don't you think ethics is also important to engineers?
</p>
<p>
  Of course,
  <a href="https://www.livemint.com/2009/01/11223309/Satyam-shows-Bschools-too-nee.html">Satyam
  is no longer on our radar</a> but Infosys has
  <a href="https://www.itbusinessedge.com/cm/blogs/tennant/us-grand-jury-subpoenas-infosys-in-visa-fraud-investigation/?cs=47148">the US authorities chasing them</a>
  and I'm sure there are
  <a href="https://www.itbusinessedge.com/cm/blogs/tennant/infosys-outgoing-chairman-sad-about-visa-fraud-investigation/?cs=47356">other
  stories</a> across the board which NASSCOM is also taking up.

  Your post makes sense.  A very good example of bad programming by
  Infosys is
  <a href="https://www.bobibanking.com/">www.bobibanking.com</a>.
  You can only make transactions on the website using Microsoft
  Internet Explorer.

  Is anyone ever going to blame the training and placement cell in
  colleges?
</p>
<p>
  In my college, students were forced to sit for the first company
  which came, Infosys.  315 of us were eligible.  Aptitude test really
  was the only place where you could get kicked out.  By randomly
  marking answers you might actually get selected in Infosys against
  your wish, so you must solve and mark the wrong answers if you don't
  want a job in Infosys.
</p>
<p>
  Not surprisingly, 210 of us cleared and 202 got the job.  8 did not
  get the job because of missing paperwork.
</p>
<p>
  Then the next company came.  The remaining students were again
  threatened to try for this company by generating a false sense of
  insecurity.  Another 84 got selected.  Another two IT companies came
  following this and picked up the best of the rest.
</p>
<p>
  After all this happened, the first startup showed up, and thanks to
  the brilliant placement policy the only people who sat for this were
  people with multiple backlogs and year drops.  I am sure the
  startups were flattered and will visit next year too!

  Along the lines of what Prashant said, I blame these companies for
  creating standardized tests as a barrier to entry, and for becoming
  reliant on these tests to sort potential employees.  Worse, I was
  floored when I came across the concept of "placement papers" which
  appear to be prevalent in India.  Unbelievable!
</p>
<p>
  If a company hands you a standardized test in your field of study,
  it says a lot about that company.  (Unable to judge talent.  Blind
  to the fact that their tests are being gamed.)  It says a lot about
  their confidence in your education.  (Is the diploma worth
  something, or does it just say that you've gone through the
  motions?)  And if a job seeker goes along with it, it says a lot
  about them, too.  (You really want a job and can't do better.  You
  went to a school that a company doesn't trust, and you're willing to
  work for a company that is demonstrating to you that it is poor with
  cultivating talent.)
