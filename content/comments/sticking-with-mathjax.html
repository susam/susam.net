  For some reason in KaTeX you have to use
  <code>\begin{aligned}</code> instead of
  <code>\begin{align}</code> but it works.

  Yes, the <code>aligned</code> environment is a different
  environment.  The <code>aligned</code> environment is available in
  MathJax too.  This environment is meant to be a part of a larger
  displayed math block, i.e. it goes between <code>\[</code>
  and <code>\]</code> or <code>$$</code> and <code>$$</code>.  The
  <code>align</code> environment, on the other hand, is a standalone
  environment that can be used outside displayed math block.
</p>
<p>
  While the <code>aligned</code> environment is supported by both
  MathJax and KaTeX, the <code>align</code> environment is supported
  by MathJax only.

  Huh, I never knew that.  Well in any case the differences are minor
  so you can just replace align with aligned.

  Esperent, Isn't the big difference equation numbering?  If you
  actually like to label and eqref stuff, it's not really a
  replacement.  You can get around this I guess, but for me, it's much
  easier if my basic LaTeX stuff works the same everywhere.
