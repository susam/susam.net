  Cory Doctorow nailed when he coined the term "enshittification" to
  describe this phenomenon.

  Great take.  Sort of inspires a thought about a clean, ethical
  social media platform.  Not to suggest anyone could build one.
  Maybe a Mastodon skin with black text on a white background and
  infinite scroll turned off.

  Hi.  Nice post.  If anyone or any senator is reading this page, I
  have one simple solution for the problem of radicalisation and
  addiction over the internet.  Pass a law that will require these
  social media companies to give users the right to turn off their
  feeds.  For example, check YouTube.  We can turn off the feed.  The
  app is not addictive.  I go to YouTube with a specific intention to
  find information about something.  All this happens because YouTube
  allows users to turn off their feeds.  So all the companies should
  do that.  They owe it to the public.

  I stopped using Facebook years ago for this very reason.  It became
  progressively less relevant to me from the notifications they'd
  surface to the content in the feed.

  I find the X "For You" vs "Following" tab to do a good job of
  showing me the stuff I care about.  A single blended list serves too
  many masters, but letting me pick "Following" gives me what I asked
  for overall.

  Same here.  Really glad you wrote this.  I jumped into the Lens
  protocol (now Lens Chain) about two and a half years ago.  Most of
  the apps I started with are long gone, but <code>orb.club</code> is
  holding it down.  It's a small community, but tight.  Plenty of
  artists, music, and raw creativity.  Definitely worth checking out.
  Thanks for putting this piece together.

  One shouldn't mistake Facebook, Twitter and Instagram for anything
  other than 'entertainment' apps.  They are no longer platforms for
  connecting with people.  You go there to be entertained.
