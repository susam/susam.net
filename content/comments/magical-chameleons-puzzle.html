  Some notation: I use tuples \( (r, g, b) \) to represent the numbers
  of chameleons of each colour at any given time.  The transformation
  \( (r', g', b') \to (r, g, b) \) denotes that the number of red,
  blue, and green chameleons changed from \( (r', g', b') \) to \( (r,
  g, b) \).  Then I work backwards in time.  So, if there are \( (r,
  g, b) \) chameleons now, the previous transformation must have been
  one of the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>\( (r - 2x, g + x, b + x) \to (r, g, b) \)</li>
  <li>\( (r + x, g - 2x, b + x) \to (r, g, b) \)</li>
  <li>\( (r + x, g + x, b - 2x) \to (r, g, b) \)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Let \( d \) be the number of blue chameleons when the zoologists
  first arrived.
</p>
<p>
  We know that when the zoologists arrived for the first time, they
  observed \( (2000, 3000, d) \).  We also know that when they arrived
  for the second time, they observed \( (5000 + d, 0, 0) \).  The
  question is: what are the possible values of \( d \)?  I answer this
  in two parts.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Part 1.</strong> <em>The integer \( d \) must be a multiple
  of 3.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Proof.</em> Let us look at how each number in the tuple change
  modulo 3 for each possible transformation.  For example, without
  loss of generality, consider the transformation \( (r - 2x, g + x, b
  + 2x) \to (r, g, b) \).  Note that \( -2x \equiv x \pmod{3} \).  So
  every transformation just adds the same number modulo 3 to each
  number in the tuple.
</p>
<p>
  We know that we start with \( (2000, 3000, d) \) and reach \( (5000
  + d, 0, 0) \).  Since the values of green and blue are congruent
  modulo 3 in the end (both are 0), therefore their values must be
  congruent modulo 3 at the start.  Hence \( d \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Part 2.</strong>
  <em>
    If \( d \) is any multiple of 3 we can find a sequence of
    transformations to go from \( (2000, 3000, d) \) to \( (5000 + d,
    0, 0) \).
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Proof</em>.  Consider \( (r, g, b) \) where \( r \ge 1 \) and \(
  g \ge 3 \).  We can get

  \[
    (r, g, b) \to (r - 1, g - 1, b + 2) \to (r + 3, g - 3, b).
  \]

  This means that we can keep taking 3 from the value of green and
  keep adding it to the value of red.  So if we start with \( (2000,
  3000, d \), we can can get \( (5000, 0, d) \).
</p>
<p>
  Similarly for \( r \ge 1 \) and \( b \ge 3 \), we can get

  \[
    (r, g, b) \to (r - 1, g + 2, b - 1) \to (r + 3, g, b - 3).
  \]

  So we can keep taking 3 from the value of blue and keep adding it to
  the value of red.  If \( d \) is a multiple of 3, we can use this to
  go from \( (5000, 0, d) \) to \( (5000 + d, 0, 0) \).
