  Logo was the best!
</p>
<p>
  I still remember my father ‘explaining’ me Pythagoras theorem when I
  was around 5 to show me how to draw the roof of a house on our
  hand-soldered Philips Apple II clone.
</p>
<p>
  I've been hooked ever since.
</p>
<p>
  The best thing was that 25 years later I opened a Logo emulator
  again and when faced with having to clean the screen somewhere deep,
  deep from my muscle memory the right command sprang
  forward: <code>CLEARSCREEN</code>.

  Oh man, PC Logo takes me back down the memory lane. We were
  introduced to PC Logo in 4th grade. That's about 9 years ago. I
  instantly fell in love with it. The amount of power I had over the
  computer - ordering it to draw what I want, how I want, was really
  exciting.
</p>
<p>
  My father had installed Kubuntu on our home computer which had an
  amazing suite of educational applications, including KTurtle which
  was (almost) the same as PC Logo. I got so addicted to it, my father
  suggested me to create a blog and regularly update it with the
  drawings and the code for
  it. <a href="http://kturtlecommands.blogspot.com/">And so I did!</a>
  Good times :).

<p>
  In the same vein:
</p>
<pre><code>CALL -151</code></pre>
<p>
  That was the entry point to Apple 2's "monitor", i.e., bare bones
  assembler. Not the most beautiful but very evocative. Gave me a
  sense of power. :-)

<p>
  The true beauty of Logo comes in the realization that you can add
  your own words to it, and that all these specialist words you devise
  are themselves first-class citizens of the language, of syntax and
  status equal to its generic builtins. For example:
</p>
<pre>
<code>TO CIRCLE
REPEAT 360 [FD 1 RT 1]
END

TO FLOWER
REPEAT 20 [CIRCLE RT 18]
END</code>
</pre>
<p>
  And so on ad infinitum, until you arrive at a complete custom
  vocabulary that concisely and precisely expresses the particular
  concepts and behaviors of interest and importance to you. In doing
  so, you move from thinking algorithmically (which is glorified
  spaghetti) to thinking compositionally, which is the key to
  scalability – managing complexity as your needs and ambitions grow.
</p>
<p>
  Whereas Algol-y languages treat user-defined vocabulary as
  second-class citizens, beneath their own privileged built-ins. Which
  is a ridiculous status when you consider which is actually important
  to the user: precise, powerful, tailored words that describe their
  particular problem, or the crude primitive undifferentiated building
  blocks that the language dumps out of the box?
</p>
<p>
  The beauty of bottom-up programming, as any Lisp fule know :), is
  that it endlessly tests your own understanding of the problem
  domain: to define effective, productive words you must have some
  idea of what you're talking about; you can't help but learn the
  foundations of the problem space as you go. There's a basic humility
  to this approach; there’s nowhere to hide laziness or ignorance.
</p>
<p>
  Whereas in top-down programming it's much too easy for
  highly-educated highly-paid absolute know-nothings to bullshit
  eternally, constructing great theatrical class architectures; grand
  mechanical castles in the sky that look all very difficult and
  impressive to observers while never saying anything relevant or
  useful.
</p>
<p>
  That key switch from algorithmic to compositional thinking is not a
  natural conceptual leap for self-learners – it takes a carefully
  directed prod at a particular point in the learning curve to jump
  those rails – but it opens up worlds. #PlatosCave

  Thanks for sharing. What a cool story! That must have been a unique
  time to grow up. Going through adolescence a decade later, computers
  and the software they ran had advanced significantly enough that the
  thought of trying to code anything at that age was never even
  considered.

<p>
  Your story helped me live through that era vicariously and I can
  imagine it would have been fascinating to my younger self as well.

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>REPEAT 20 [REPEAT 180 [FD 1 RT 2] RT 18]</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
  It's a great image because it reminds me exactly of what we used to
  do, especially the <code>REPEAT 180</code> with <code>RT 2</code>
  instead of <code>REPEAT 360</code> to avoid repeating the circle
  twice since the circle looks the same anyway on those monitors. Once
  you move up to <code>RT 3</code> or more it begins to look a bit
  more like a polygon.

  I started with LOGO at school and it was a great teaching language
  and gave me a good basis (e.g. we did a ton of recursive stuff) and
  a passion for creating things with code.

  Logo wasn't the first language I started with (that would be BASIC),
  but it is one I have many fond memories of from childhood. I used
  Logo later on to program microcontrollers used with Lego to build
  simple robots and machines. One of my proudest moments was building
  a functional prototype of a washing machine with selectable wash
  cycles. It allowed me to begin understanding many of the things
  which we find in the world that rely on small embedded electronics
  to function.
</p>
<p>
  I wish there were programs like this for children these days in
  school. I know Scratch derived from Lego Logo and there's still
  things like Lego Mindstorm, but I don't think there are many common
  programs at least in the US to teach children programming and
  prototyping using these simple mechanisms.

  I remember reading about Seymour Papert's Logo back in the 80's and
  getting blown away by how elegant and luxurious the language felt.
  But, the need to start Logo environment first in order to run a
  program kept me away from it so I kept working with BASIC and
  Assembly. That kind of friction matters a lot.

  "FD 100" was my introduction to programming too! This short post
  just brought it all back!
</p>
<p>
  I've remembered for years that there was some for-loop syntax that
  I'd used as a kid. I knew it wasn't <code>for</code> so
  seeing <code>REPEAT 360 [FD 1 RT 1]</code> was quite a revelation
  for me just now! That's exactly what I was writing back then. I
  think my first instinct at the time was <code>REPEAT 4 [FD 100 RT
    90]</code> and from there went on to draw pentagons, hexagons, and
  then at some point had a eureka moment and tried <code>REPEAT
    360</code> &hellip; mind blown!

<p>
  I was using
  an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_PCW#PCW_8256_and_8512">Amstrad
    PCW 8512</a> and would love to hear from anyone else who had a
  similar experience.

  Baliex, I had an 8256. I read some code in a magazine showing how to
  draw fractals recursively (they were Koch snowflakes actually) and I
  had a lot of fun making more complex fractals using that basic
  recipe. The PCWs had a monochrome screen that was quite hi-res,
  certainly compared to what I was used to, which worked well for
  turtle graphics.

  As someone who hasn't done graphics programming (or anything like
  this), it's amazing to me how simple directives can yield such
  things. Is this type of logic still used in games/graphic
  programming today?

  Sili, It can, and it does, sort of! There's a bit more boilerplate
  in most environments designed for shipping things, but one of the
  more high power/terseness activities is writing a shader that can
  render signed distance fields. The article
  at <a href="https://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/distfunctions/distfunctions.htm">https://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/distfunctions/distfunctions.htm</a>
  compose a few of these together and you can manifest some pretty
  nuts infinity fractals. Here's a video I made playing with the
  functions

  Sili, Sort of related to games/graphics programming - There's an
  open source CAD program
  called <a href="https://openscad.org/">OpenSCAD</a> that allows you
  to create 3D models with code that can be simple, but gets complex
  fast. I personally tried using it to create models for 3D printing,
  but got overwhelmed and decided to go to other tools.

  Lovely post, though it's weird to end in saying that this "gave me a
  brief taste of functional programming". Turtle drawing is arguably
  the most non-functional, stateful programming paradigm ever
  invented.

  This was a great blast from the past. A few friends of mine and I
  would write down instructions to draw crude pictures in Logo; the
  usual sorts of things you'd expect from kids.
</p>
<p>
  I'm sure lots of other kids did the same thing; kind of a fun way to
  sneak into writing programs&emdash;a low barrier to entry, and
  immediate results you could tinker with.
</p>
<p>
  Is there something popular like this today?

  DrCode, Well, they say that <em>Logo</em> gave them a taste of
  functional programming, which is a broader statement than turtle
  drawing. Logo was strongly influenced by Lisp and, consequently, is
  a multi-paradigm language including functional as one of its
  paradigms.

  Paul, A lot of kids (middle and high schoolers) these days have pet
  projects like making HTML-based website and writing a discord bot in
  JavaScript. The fact that our district hands out Chromebooks
  probably contributes to the trend.

  DrCode, Logo is more than the turtle. Brian Harvey wrote a whole
  series of textbooks for Logo that really stressed the functional
  aspect of the language:

  DrCode, You can think of it that way, but you can also think of a
  Logo program as a purely functional computation that follows the
  monad laws. Here's a Haskell package that implements it:

  Last night I was chatting with my girlfriend (who works as a CAD
  designer in textile industry) about Logo! Like the author of this
  post, Logo was my first language, and I was really excited to draw
  squares, cubes, and rocket ships, between the ages of 7 and 9. I had
  a lot of fun experimenting with the audio frequency generation as
  well, composing some basic songs (Ode to Joy, Au Clair De La Lune,
  Fr&egrave;re Jacques).
</p>
<p>
  Years later, when I was 26, I got to use Logo again! I wanted to
  draw a time-proportional train map of Taiwan. The distance between
  each point on the map corresponds to the time it takes a local train
  to travel that far. It made more sense to do that in Logo than in
  any other language. So I rewrote a basic Logo implementation in
  JavaScript and called it
  TurtleSheet: <a href="http://peterburk.github.io/tra/">http://peterburk.github.io/tra/</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I hope that some teachers will see the potential of empowering kids,
  by giving them real-world data like public transport times, and
  getting some real designs out.
