Wow, Flashback! I too started with Logo. I didn't know that it's related
to Lisp.

Nice work. I was in shock when I saw the splash screen. I had used IBM
BASIC from July 1980 until Sept 1983, when I took a Pascal class. I was
taking Fortran on the mainframe, Cobol on the mini, and Pascal on a PC.
I had seen Logo on a Apple ][ but I was more interested in data
processing.
