  When facing binary choices (yes/no), stupidity is being ~50%
  correct, not ~0% correct.  When someone is correct, e.g. only 5% of
  times, it means they're strongly anticorrelated with reality, and
  you just have to do the opposite of what they say to be 95% correct.

  We named people like Bob "Oracles of Wrong".
</p>
<p>
  In any big enough group there is always an Oracle of Wrong.  They
  are very precious.  It's very hard to be right all the time, but
  less hard to be wrong all the time.
</p>
<p>
  Over decades I have puzzled over the existence of Oracles of Wrong.
  One clue is that they always come from privileged backgrounds.
  Taking the easy, wrong choice has never caused them any personal
  discomfort, but has often saved them some minor inconvenience that
  the hard, right choice would have cost.

  I was initially expecting this to be about power law distributions,
  such that Bob was right about the high impact 5%, and Alex about the
  orders of magnitude less impactful 80%.  If only decision spaces
  were so bipartite!
