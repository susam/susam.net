  Susam,
</p>
<p>
  Nice blog post!  But it looks like you are discrediting many people
  working in these companies by your blog post.  Let me clarify.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      About the training sessions, whose fault is it that the trainees
      absorb only 1% of the knowledge?  If the trainees are good
      enough, they can always learn the stuff taught without problems.
      Anyway, the organization you are referring to where a
      programming language is taught in 3 days might be the only one
      doing it.  The organization I work for trained us in an
      application for many days with a thorough syllabus.  And when
      our organization tried to train people on different programming
      languages quickly, it was assumed that they would know pretty
      much of that already because of their engineering studies or
      because they were picked from the best institutions like NIT,
      IIT, etc.  So they probably do assume that since these trainees
      are getting paid more and are from better colleges, their
      ability to grasp new things would be much higher than the rest.
      Anyway, this is just my viewpoint, just like the blog post is
      your viewpoint.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      What do you mean by engineering?  The only engineering I hear
      about in these companies is in the field of Product Engineering
      (and maybe where they use VLSI and stuff).  But this is a small
      sector of these organizations.  They have many more sectors
      where the requirement is to fulfill the client's requirements.
      As simple as that.  Be it providing a service like
      administration or create new applications.  But seldom are
      people told to "create" products for companies, especially the
      BFSI sector which is primarily one of the highest revenue
      earners for these organizations.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      I myself work in data warehousing and don't have anything to do
      with creating Products or writing millions lines of code.  But
      we are directly interfaced with business.  We create critical
      applications for the client using our ETL tools.  So is this
      work bad?  Is this work something that engineers aren't supposed
      to be doing?  Then who is supposed to be doing this?  And do
      note that this job requires very high analytical skills which
      engineers should have in them.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Culture: Well, I can agree on some points that you made.  But
      you cannot classify the whole organization into this.  What do
      you mean when you say these people are "software-tailors"?
      Aren't these professionals building something for someone?  Are
      you saying that anybody who can browse the internet and knows
      about computers can do our jobs?  Don't you think we would find
      that a bit insulting?  It might be true in many cases where the
      proper training can make a monkey do our jobs, but isn't that
      true for many fields?  Aren't monkeys being trained to pilot
      airships?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Onsite: I won't comment on this since I am onsite.  But do know
      this that there is a chance that someone might actually like the
      way business is done onsite and the work culture out here.  And
      yes, money is a big factor.  Will you say that a poor man's son
      who is in onsite earning money for his family is greedy?  So its
      all about perception.  So the picture isn't always black and
      white my friend.  You need to factor in everyone's needs and
      desires.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Anyway, no offense to you or your blog post.  Just wanted to point
  out that everyone's perception is different.  Since you do not work
  with any of these companies now, its easy to be outside and comment.
  But I've been with my organization for quite some time now and I
  feel absolutely fine with that.  Anyways, thank you for an
  opportunity for a healthy debate.

  Sambeet,
</p>
<p>
  This blog post is not about why the training is not effective or
  whether monkeys are being trained to pilot airships.  This blog post
  answers the question, "Infosys, TCS, or Wipro?"  The answer I choose
  is:
  <em>"None."</em>
</p>
<p>
  Your second point allows the possibility that the work can be done
  by a high school student with a crash course on software and that is
  precisely what these companies do, but with engineering graduates.
  I didn't see any mention or hint of a concrete engineering problem
  in your second point that requires engineering skill or knowledge.
  Perhaps, "engineering" means different things to both of us.
</p>
<p>
  Building things isn't a proof of being engineers.  Building things
  like engineers is.  Your fourth point also demonstrates how the
  employees of these companies convince themselves that they are
  professional engineers just because they can create a working
  software.  Sadly, the fact is that people of these companies build
  software in a manner some school kid with no knowledge of
  programming or engineering would do.
</p>
<p>
  In your fifth point, you seem to agree that going onsite is less
  about one's technical prowess and passion for engineering.  So what
  you are saying here is consistent with what I am saying in my blog
  post.

<p>
  @Sambeet, Isn't that true?  In my last 1.5 years in infosys, I have
  not done any work which required me to use any engineering skills.
  All I do is write JavaScript to take care of user input.  You call
  that engineering?

  coward due to legal reasons.  :] I am quite alarmed by Sambeet's
  response, especially his 5th point, where he writes that the Indian
  vendors send their employees to work on client's site not because
  they are proficient in technology but because you need to factor in
  everyone's needs and desiers.  Excuse me!  We need good technology
  people.  Why can't you guys just be professional and keep your
  personal lives and poverty aside while discussing technology?

  Great post, Susam!  But I disagree that startups are a good place to
  get real engineering work where we can use our engineering
  knowledge.  Many startups in India also do only "sofware-tailor"
  type of job.  But I agree that there are good startups also where we
  can get good engineering problems to work on.  Freshers should
  always choose a startup over Infosys, Wipro, or TCS if they want to
  learn useful things.
</p>
<p>
  Sambeet, you asked:
</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>
  I will say, yes.  If you are talking about software like crappy SBI
  bank sofware or ICICI bank software which cannot run reliably all
  the time, keeps crashing at the drop of a hat, then yes anbody who
  can browse the internet and knows about computer and a little bit
  programming can do your jobs.

<p>
  Well, with due respect to you opinions, I will share mine.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Absorbing the knowledge shared in training is the responsibility
      of the employee.  And definitely more than 1% get this
      knowledge.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Engineering does happen.  More than what we have learnt in
      school and college.  While we learn theory at college, here you
      solve real world business problems.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      People who work are well qualified for the job.  Some are much
      more qualified than an Engineer - a CA, a MBA, a PhD, etc. - and
      sharing your work space with these guys does broaden your
      spectrum.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      As for culture, it is we the people who build it.  It is a sum
      of parts - with each of us being a part.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      As for onsite travel, it is based on various factors.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  All in all, things are not as bad as perceived.

<p>
  Hey Susam,
</p>
<p>
  Saw this debate going on and couldn't help but jump in.  Before I
  start, let me point out a couple of ground realities:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      All the three companies you named self-confess that they work in
      the "services" domain.  There is no mention of "engineering"
      anywhere.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      These are mass recruiters.  They recruit people who don't have a
      chance of joining google or RSA just out of college.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Having said that, I come back to the question you asked.  My take
  would be joining these companies is good in two cases:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      You love computers and like solving real world problems using
      computers.  But you don't have a degree from the heavy weight
      colleges, so don't have a chance in the biggies of the industry.
      Get in these companies, use them as a launchpad and get ahead in
      your life.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      You don't know anything about computers, but want to earn a
      decent white-collar living.  Get into these companies, get set
      for your life.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  I don't think there is any third category of people joining these or
  rather any other company in the industry.
</p>
<p>
  I rest my case.  :)

<p>
  Paritosh,
</p>
<p>
  Regarding using these companies as launchpad, I am not quite getting
  it.  In fact, if you study in a not so good college and work in
  these companies for 5+ years, your resume is worthless and you
  cannot launch yourself anywhere.  I worked for 2.5 years in one of
  these companies (in addition to having a degree from a not so good
  college) and from my personal experience I can say for sure that it
  only adds one more hurdle to jump if at all you manage to launch a
  career later.

  @Vyankatesh, Err...  What?  You've got CAs, MBAs in Infosys, Wipro,
  and TCS and so it broadens your spectrum?  You think CAs and MBAs
  don't exist in better companies?  And what has the presence of CAs
  and MBAs have to do with engineering?  It is funny that people from
  these companies who are coming to this blog post to defend their
  employers are making matters worse and showing us how sorry the
  state of these companies are.  The people defending these companies
  in these comments have not worked in a company where real
  engineering work happens and so do not even know what they are
  talking about.

  Paritosh,
</p>
<p>
  I think starting a career in Infosys, TCS, or Wipro is a very bad
  way of starting a career.  Sambeet and Vyankatesh are the biggest
  examples of why it is a bad way to make a career.  After they stay
  in these companies they become institutionalized.  Their outlook of
  the technology world becomes so narrow that they believe whatever
  they are doing is engineering and everywhere it is like this.  They
  are not in a position to even accept that their work is something
  that does not need engineering graduates.  Anyone with internet
  connection can do that work.  It is because of this that people like
  these cannot get out of these companies and remain stuck in these
  companies forever only to come and post in blog posts like this and
  mislead general public when someone tries to expose the truths about
  these companies to the outside world.  No real technology company
  would like to hire people with such narrow outlook.
</p>
<p>
  I very much agree with Prunthaban that once you stay in these
  companies for a few years, your resume is screwed because every
  technology giant knows what kind of crap these companies hire.

  I have led a project where we interacted with one of the three
  companies mentioned in this article.  One thing I can say for sure
  that there is no such thing as a good engineer in these companies.
  They were supposed to deliver a project in 3 months' time.  Not only
  did they lack severely in technical skills, they handled the project
  very unprofessionally and their behavior showed complete lack of
  integrity.
</p>
<p>
  Deadlines were missed, delivery was delayed and even after the
  delay, the delivery was not functional.  There were numerous bugs
  which showed a basic lack of understanding of the system among the
  developers.  Deadlocks in databases were common and when we filed a
  ticket we realized that the engineers lacked a basic understanding
  of what kind of operations lead to deadlocks.
</p>
<p>
  Despite being clearly spelled out in the document that the software
  must make use of multithreading to take advantage of the multicore
  servers we use, we did not find performance improvements when we
  increased the number of threads.  We expected linear improvement in
  the performance with the increase in the number of threads.  They
  kept insisting that they had multithreading in the software but our
  analysis contradicted their claims.  We had to escalate the matter
  and asked them to rewrite the multithreading code.  The most ironic
  part of the whole affair was that our engineers had to work with
  their engineers and supervise them to get the multithreading part
  done correctly.  After such a horrible experience I can very
  confidently confirm that the third point in this blog post about the
  lack of true engineers in these organizations is 100% true.

<p>
  @Prunthaban, Vamsi, et al.,
</p>
<p>
  When people say working in these companies for 5+ years makes your
  resume is worthless and you cannot launch yourself anywhere, I feel
  they are hiding behind excuses.  You don't need a great company to
  write beautiful code.  What you need is belief in yourself and basic
  analytical and logical abilities.
</p>
<p>
  Lots of people have come out from these companies and gone to write
  great code.  I personally know a few.  Heck, even the author of this
  post used one of these so called crappy companies to launch his
  career (sorry Susam for bringing this up).
</p>
<!-- date: 2011-05-16 04:19:45 +0000 -->
<!-- name: Prunthaban -->
<!-- url: https://twitter.com/pruntz -->
<p>
  Paritosh,
</p>
<p>
  I think you have misunderstood me.  I am not saying people who work
  in these companies will always write crappy code :-) I worked in one
  of these companies for 2.5 years and I have met/seen great coders
  (including the author of this post as you rightly said).  These
  people are great coders because they used their extra-time to learn
  stuff.  But a good engineering company will make you learn all this
  the easier way through your day to day job itself (How many times
  you get the chance to see a piece of code written by really great
  coders with 20+ years of experience in one of these mentioned
  companies?).
</p>
<p>
  My point is that when a person working in these companies decide to
  launch a different career, these companies in your resume makes it
  'one more hurdle' to jump.  I am not saying it is impossible.  I am
  only saying that having these companies do hinder your progress.  I
  spent 2.5 years and I can say with confidence that if I had spent
  that 2.5 years in some other engineering company I would have been
  in an even better position.  I am sure that applies to Susam too.

<p>
  You mentioned:
</p>
<blockquote>

  up).
</blockquote>
<p>
  I did start my career in one of these three companies I've mentioned
  in the title of this post.  But it is a negative point rather than a
  positive point in my resume.  It didn't help me at all when I went
  to interview with RSA.  What helped though were the reading and
  application-security related projects I did late at nights after
  spending 9 to 10 hours daily at work.  I got the job at RSA.
</p>
<p>
  Prunthaban too has a similar story.  When he applied to Google, his
  prior work experience at one of these three companies turned out to
  be useless.  However, he had done a lot of hard work in algorithms
  and software design area out of his own interest.  He used to
  regularly participate in Topcoder and CodeChef algorithm contests.
  Due to his strong foundation in algorithms and data structures that
  he had built out of his own interest in his personal time, he got
  the job at Google.
</p>
<p>
  If I had known what I have shared in this post 5 years ago, I would
  have never made the mistake of starting my career in one of these
  three companies.  As you can see from Prunthaban's comment, he feels
  the same way too.

  Good post.  But I think you should mention that your post is meant
  for computer science engineers and their lack of engineering skills
  because these organizations are IT/software firms.
</p>
<p>
  There are solid points for discussions about why engineers from
  other backgrounds get into these firms but as I can see from your
  post, you were mostly aiming at IT/CS folks though not explicitly
  addressed to them.
</p>
<p>
  Startups find it difficult to get fresh engineers as these
  organizations do because there is a social aura in favour of these
  companies more than anything else.

<p>
  Ravishankar,
</p>
<p>
  I am not specifically aiming at IT/CS engineers.  Some of these
  companies need other kinds of engineers too.  Unfortunately, no
  matter what kind of engineers they are, there knowledge and
  engineering skills have been found to be dismal.  Some examples from
  my personal experience:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      An entire team of electronics engineers did not know basic
      digital logic.  Hence, they were unable to think of efficient
      solutions to some real world business problems that could be
      solved in a very elegant and efficient manner using digital
      logic.  I have selected one of those problems and mentioned it
      in point 3 of my blog post.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      I have met people with degree in electronics and communications
      engineering in one of these companies who did not know about
      information entropy and hence were unable to take decisions
      about data compression.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      In one of these companies, I have met an electronics engineer
      who configured a circuit incorrectly because he did not know
      that a p-n junction diode requires forward bias to "turn it on".
      In the same company, I have met a couple of computer science
      engineers who did not know that a regular expression cannot be
      used to match strings with balanced parentheses.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Now, these are really basic concepts in the respective engineering
  fields.  If people who do not know such basic concepts about their
  fields are working in good positions (they are sometimes project
  leads too) in these companies, it speaks a lot about what kind of
  engineering these people must be doing and what kind of software or
  other non-software projects these people must be building.
</p>
<p>
  We have digressed from the point I've tried to make in this post.  I
  am not really concerned with the kind of software they are building.
  I am concerned what my friends who ask, "Infosys, Wipro, or TCS?",
  are going to learn in these companies.  My answer to them is,
  "None", because I want them to look for a good startup or a reputed
  technology company with a good engineering culture known for hiring
  good engineers where they can learn how to solve problems
  efficiently and correctly from other senior engineers.

  Hi Susam,
</p>
<p>
  It is really great to see you write this eye-opening article.  It
  helps two kinds of people.  Those who want to ask this question will
  think twice before even asking this question.  Those who are there
  sailing in the boat of these IT companies might realize something
  and break out from the shackles of hollowness.

  Hi Susam,
</p>
<p>
  Great blog post!  You have missed one more myth that needs
  attention.
</p>
<p>
  Brand name: Students feel that Infosys, TCS, or Wipro are great
  brand names.  It is far from the truth.  Infosys, TCS, or Wipro are
  embarrassing brand names to write in your resume unless you want to
  join another Infosys, TCS, Wipro like company such as Cognizant,
  Accenture, etc. who are ready to hire any crap that comes out of
  Infosys, TCS, and Wipro.  Good technology companies know that these
  brand names are like balloons.  They look big from outside but has
  nothing apart from gas inside.  Actually an engineer from a good but
  less popular startup has a better chance than a person from Infosys
  to get a job in a big technology company.

      not force me to follow them.  Why can't I do it the right way?

    <p>
      Engineers: 1:200 is not under my control.  A company has the
      rights to choose how many engineers and how many janitors they
      need.  I would choose to be an engineer anyways.

      Culture: For gossipping or cribbing why do you have to go to
      Infy/Wipros?  You can just be a blogger!  (pun intended)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Onsite: The so called "engineers" study theories and algorithms
      created by Dijkstras, Adlemans and Tanenbaums.  Why wouldn't an
      engineer want to meet people like them?
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Having said all that I myself am a bootstrapper and run a startup.
  And I can tell you that most of the average fresh-out-of-college
  engineers wouldn't survive in a startup for the very exact reasons
  you have given.

  Narayan Babu,

<p>
  It seems to me that you have left your comment for the sole purpose
  of disagreeing with my post without really knowing or having a first
  hand experience of what these companies are.  However, I'll take it
  in stride.  :-)
</p>
<p>
  Here is what I have got to say for each of your points:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      In my opinion, one should always strive to be in the company of
      engineers who are better because it exposes one to challenging
      problems and ideas on a daily basis.  This accelerates the pace
      of learning new concepts severalfold.  Yes, one can definitely
      learn through self-study using the internet, books and online
      friends, but the experience of working with a talented and
      experienced senior engineer sitting next to you is priceless.
      It only adds.  I don't see how it subtracts.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      You have a very wrong idea about these companies if you believe
      that you are not forced to follow bad software practices in
      these companies.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      I agree that you don't have control on how many good engineers a
      company like Infosys, TCS, or Wipro hires.  But you do have
      control to join a different organisation which hires good
      engineers.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The corporate network of any good company is and should be much
      more civil and conducive to development than the internet.  In
      these companies the situation is reversed.  I don't understand
      what your point about culture is then.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      One does not meet Dijkstras and Adlemans by going onsite.  That
      takes a lot more effort than just going onsite.  I can tell you
      this from my personal experience.  ;-)
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  You also seem to undermine the capabilities of fresh engineering
  graduates.  Also, it seems like you fail to attract the best talent.
  I have interviewed many fresh engineering graduates who are way
  better than people with 5 to 10 years of experience in these three
  companies.  We have no trouble attracting good talent where I work
  now.  One of the brightest engineers I work with joined straight out
  of college last year and now sits next to me.

  I just want to say that not all engineers plan to go for core jobs
  while studying.  I was always interested to work in IT but had to
  get a good engineering degree to fulfill that dream.  It sounds bad
  but I don't use my engineering skills at my job.  But I've learnt a
  lot more now and I use that in my job.  And yes, I am proud that
  I've nothing to do with "engineering" and am still happy with it.
</p>
<p>
  In the end, I guess Susam wanted to highlight that not much
  engineering might be happening in these companies.  I won't comment
  on that since I was never into that field as such.  But I do know of
  many software engineering patents coming out of these companies so I
  guess they must be doing something right.  But these companies have
  never claimed to be engineering companies and have always been IT
  services companies.  So Susam is correct in saying that engineers
  who want to use their knowledge they gained during engineering
  should not join these 3 companies.  The only thing you need to see
  is how much percentage of engineers actually choose to do so.

  Hi Susam,
</p>
<p>
  You wrote this in the end:
</p>
<blockquote>
  An interview is not only an opportunity for an organization to
  evaluate an applicant, it is also an opportunity for the applicant
  to evaluate an organization.
</blockquote>
<p>
  This is exactly true!  I was very happy that the interviewer didn't
  ask me many technical questions when I went to interview for one of
  these three companies.  Now I am feeling the heat.
</p>
<p>
  I would like to call my role as cyber-coolie and not a software
  engineer.
</p>
<p>
  I totally agree with you when you say that this is no engineering.
  Perhaps that is why my employer realised this and removed
  "Technologies" from its name.  :P
</p>
<p>
  Onsite travel is now no longer a lucrative opportunity.  Too many
  onsite engineers work as production support guys.  That is horrible!
  But given that you get some decent money, people don't complain.
</p>
<p>
  These companies say that the engineering colleges are not training
  students to be skilled enough to be at par with the industry
  standards.  I would like to ask them, "Do these companies match the
  skills of the students?"
</p>
<p>
  I say to my juniors, "If you think you did something or learnt
  something in the four years of engineering, dont join these
  companies."  :)
</p>

  I completely agree with you, Susam and Prunthaban.  Even I lived in
  that shell of IT services companies for a couple of years.  Then I
  moved to a startup.
</p>
<p>
  Now when attending interviews, my toughest task is covering up my
  work in the first company.
</p>
<p>
  @Ajit Sahoo, Startup doesn't mean new company.  Susam has given some
  excellent examples of startups.  Companies like Flipkart, Zoho, and
  Aryaka are a few more examples I would like to add.

  You know this is exactly the idealistic post that wants to make you
  feel I am the rockstar because I did not join any of these
  companies.  I disagree with you.
</p>
<p>
  I don't work in these organisations, but let me tell you, this whole
  startup culture we are seeing just because the US is exploding is
  farcical in my opinion.  Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Palantir,
  etc. are exceptions and not the norm.  You know why people work
  there?  Because they did their engineering right in college.  So any
  engineer who got his education right will always find ways to solve
  problems.  It is very easy to criticise the processes and
  methodologies of these organisations, but only true engineers can
  improve them.  Most of the startups preach about work culture,
  freedom, etc.  Very few startups in India actually try or think
  computationally.  Most of these startups are web-based products and
  sure as hell don't apply your graph algorithms or even basic
  algorithms.
</p>
<p>
  I am not saying these organisations are the best thing to happen to
  our country.  Infact I think they might be a reason why one day we
  actually have recession and people go jobless.  My point is that if
  you get here, try to be your man/woman.  Work hard and learn as much
  as you can.  We still don't have startups which are actually using
  computer science.  There's more direction towards solving a problem
  which could make money for you.  You can easily find out about these
  startups by looking at their hiring page.  How many will appreciate
  your knowledge of Lisp or assembly programming or that someone has
  read CLRS or TAOCP.  All they look for is a very good PHP developer
  to build stuff for them.  If you want to learn, get your education
  right.  The rest will follow.

  examples.

  Ajit and Amey,

<p>
  I have worked in one crappy company mentioned in the title of this
  blog post.  Then I switched to a startup.  I agree that all startups
  don't have good engineers.  But many of them have.  So I still
  disagree that somebody should join Infosys, TCS, or Wipro and try to
  be his own man/woman.  The culture, stupid processes, tech leads of
  these companies force you to develop software projects in bad ways.
</p>
<p>
  It is always better to join startups if you don't get a call from
  Google, Microsoft, etc.  I don't agree that if your education is
  right, then the rest will follow.  Correct information is necessary
  or inexperienced engineers will fall for overhyped brand names like
  Infosys, TCS, and Wipro in spite of good education like I fell for
  the hype.  This blog post does very nice job of providing correct
  information.
</p>
<p>
  After one year, I switched to startup.  Now I am doing better work
  and I am happy.

  Amey,
</p>
<p>
  You are not well informed.  Each startup suggestion posted by Susam
  are very respectable companies.  They are also popular for keeping
  their employees happy.  If you think SlideShare.net only hires good
  PHP developers I have only one thing to say.  Please update your
  knowledge about these companies before posting incorrect
  information.  SlideShare.net does a good variety of work.  They have
  a good variety of openings too.  New engineers from colleges who
  join there start working on creating Ruby or Python API in the
  beginning.  Eventually they get to work on distributed systems,
  map-reduce, search engines, analytics, recommendation systems,
  etc. within one or two years.  All of these require good core
  computer science knowledge, algorithms, and also graph theory.
</p>
<p>
  So please refrain from posting incorrect comments without doing
  proper research.

  All,
</p>
<p>
  Read all of the comments to the post and found them informative.
  But for me, being just a student, these comments confused me more.
  Having attended a pre-placement presentation of one of these
  companies in the morning itself, I was, before reading this, sure of
  what my dream job was.  But now this blog post has definitely budged
  my perceptions.  Regarding startups, what do they look for in an
  engineering student?  Does the graduation institute matter?  I must
  mention I am not from a very known college.  What I couldn't
  understand from the blog post is where to apply as a fresh
  engineering graduate?  What are the pre-requisites and whether to
  pursue further studies?  Thanks!
</p>

  Abhay,
</p>
<p>
  There is no general answer.  Different startups have different
  requirements.  The companies have careers/jobs pages in their
  websites.  They should give you some ideas.  No need to be from a
  very known college for startups.  They can't afford to keep
  engineers who can't do work.  So they hire with care.  So just be
  good with your concepts.

  I don't know if this has been brought up yet, but the blog post
  seems to say that you don't find challenging problems in these big
  IT companies, and hence the work you do there is not really
  "engineering".
</p>
<p>
  What is not appreciated is that these companies are <em>huge</em>
  and somewhere some team certainly is working on challenging
  projects.  They even have dedicated research groups.  However, you
  must proactively look for them, and persistently try to join them.
  Just as they have "real" problems, they need "real" engineers to
  solve them, and requests will eventually be granted if they see that
  you are really good.
</p>
<p>
  10 years ago, a friend was very interested in aeronautics, and he
  actually found a related project in Infosys.  Aeronautics, of all
  things!
</p>
<p>
  It's just the nature of IT outsourcing that 95% of the work is
  non-challenging CRUD work but then 95% of employees don't want
  challenging work anyways.  Be in the other 5%.

  IMHO, engineering is not always about doing low-level coding.  It is
  also about designing highly scalable systems, algorithms,
  applications, and building them.  :-)

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>
  That's only true for problems that <em>can</em> be solved without
  engineering.  A large fraction of IT outsourcing projects are
  enterprise applications, used only by hundreds or thousands of
  people at most.  They don't face, for instance, the scalability
  problems that require good engineering, and hence simple solutions
  and brute force is sufficient for most of these.
</p>
<p>
  However, there certainly are projects with hard problems where only
  proper engineering can get the work done.  Or sometimes, otherwise
  dull projects throw up a small but really hard problem.  When I was
  there 10 years ago, I was aware of people in each of these companies
  solving problems that required thoughtful engineering.
  Unsurprisingly, they were also seen as the most valuable employees,
  the "go-to" people whenever hard problems come up.
</p>
<p>
  Granted that these were rare cases.  But I think it will get better
  with the US companies beginning to outsource their R&amp;D to India
  in addition to the dull IT stuff.

  After reading all these comments I just want to say that everyone

  the suggestions.  I've heard a lot about these firms.  My seniors
  who have worked with these firms warned me earlier not to join them.
  I know many people who left these companies.
</p>
<p>
  Besides this one more thing I would like to say that if you are
  about to graduate and you have got a job in Infosys, TCS, or Wipro,
  it really matters very much because of the big name associated with
  them.  Many of us want to know which type of environment,
  professionalism, people, and opportunities are there.  Some people
  say these are good.  Some say they aen't.  I've not joined any of
  these yet.  But I'll think about it when the time comes.  I don't
  want to waste my time by taking a wrong decision.  Thank you for
  writing this blog post.

  I suggest looking for other job offers instead of joining Infosys,
  TCS, or Wipro.  Upload your resume to job portals.  You may get
  calls from startups.  No offence meant but unless you want to end up
  like Sambeet Sahoo working with ETL tools in these companies till
  you grow old, Infosys, TCS, and Wipro are not worth joining.
</p>
<p>
  Infosys, TCS, and Wipro are big names but not necessarily in a
  positive way.  You shall realize it later when you try to apply to
  big sofware companies or startups that do good engineering work.
  Listen to your seniors who have warned you about these companies.
  They are right.

  First of all, nice blog post.  Very informative to students like me
  who are almost ready to step out of college.  After reading this
  post, I must admit that I am in a big state of confusion on what to
  do and what not to.  Unfortunately, I have been placed in one of
  these IT Companies in college.  Fortunately, I haven't joined them
  yet.  My engineering course is still going on and I am expecting my
  joining date to be at least 3 months away from now.
</p>
<p>
  I have a good academic record throughout my career and an excellent
  extracurricular track record.
</p>
<p>
  You said in your blog post:
</p>
<blockquote>
  Remember the technical problems they discuss in the interview.  Think
  about them later.
</blockquote>
<p>
  This is now bothering me because this happened to me during the
  interview, exactly as you described in your post.  They did not ask
  me any good technical problems at all in the technical interviews.
  They only asked a few basic questions about the syntax of
  <code>case</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>while</code>, etc.  I still
  think they just recruited me because of my high academic scores.
</p>
<p>
  I come from a not so good college where one of these companies is
  projected as the ultimate company that one can get into during
  campus placements.  I am not blaming my institution for it as it is
  situated in a semi-urban place where this is the best that they
  could get for us.
</p>
<p>
  I received a lot of input about this from my seniors.  They have
  mixed opinions about these IT services companies.  Some of them say
  that these companies are good but the majority of them have the same
  opinion as yours.
</p>
<p>
  My question is: If I choose to not join it and look out for other
  jobs from startups or other companies, where do you think real
  engineering is being done?  Where can I really learn?  How do i get
  into such companies?
</p>
<p>
  I may not be the best technically skilled guy that they are looking
  for.  I must admit that I am poor in DFAs, graphs, and algorithms.
  But given a chance and time, I can learn these topics and deliver
  what is expected from me.  I am really passionate about technology
  and 100% committed in whatever i do.  I presume that these startups
  really look for guys who have done some extraordinary stuff like
  hacking, patents, and others.  But right now I'm building a cloud
  application as a part of my final year project.
</p>
<p>
  How can I get in touch with these startups and real engineering
  companies?  What do they look for?  What are my options?

  Hi Susam,

  You did not speak about the pay scale of these companies when
  compared with other high paying companies.  Can you please provide
  some information regarding this?

  @Vijay, The companies Susam is talking about (the IT services firms)
  have terrible pay scales.  We are a startup and our starting
  salaries are nearly double that of Infosys.
</p>
<p>
  You can email me at my first name @ c42.in.

  Some points are debatable as mentioned in one of the comments.  But
  as far as doing <em>real engineering work</em> is concerned you are
  absolutely right.
</p>
<p>
  I haven't joined any startup but I haven't joined any of these three
  companies either.
</p>
<p>
  In a nutshell, this is a very nicely written blog post!  A must read

  I have never worked in any of the mentioned companies but I have
  heard many tales of horror from my friends who have.  Having worked
  in two good startups (in fact, still at the second one), I concur
  that a lot of good engineering happens in these small companies
  which the mainstream media is not familiar with.
</p>
<p>
  There are a lot of good startups coming up in various parts of
  India.  I urge all engineers to consider them if they genuinely want
  to engineer great stuff.

<p>
  Having worked for both: an MNC and a startup (in that order), I
  cannot resist commenting on this.
</p>
<p>
  I agree with all the points of yours.  MNCs in India hire engineers
  and convert them to software-tailors.  I was lucky enough to realise
  this within 5 months and switched jobs.
</p>
<p>
  All that these so called hotshots worry about is billing and bench
  strength.  During my short stay in one of these, there was a point
  where I was doing work which a high school student could do even
  though I am a postgraduate in computer science.
</p>
<p>
  From my experience (both during and after the MNC job), I believe
  that people join them for job security (it takes months before
  someone realises that you are not working good enough and should be
  fired) and a chance to earn more money from onsite travel.
</p>
<p>
  Overall, this post is very nice advice for fresh engineering
  graduates.  I appreciate it.

  Hi Susam,
</p>
<p>
  I agree with you on some points.  But I would like to make a few
  points.  You said that these organizations teach a new programming
  language in 3 days!  They hav chosen engineers from engineering
  colleges, so the students which they hav recruited are expected to
  have sufficient knowledge of the engineering syllabus!  These
  companies are not there to provide these students a degree.  They
  just want to provide them with a basic knowledge of what they have
  already learnt in their engineering!
</p>
<p>
  For the rest of the post, hats off to you!  What a nice post!

  Hi Susam,
</p>
<p>
  Excellent blog post!  I think the best thing a student can do after
  graduating is either join a good startup or create their own
  startup.  They will learn more in 2 years than they would have in
  any other company.  I feel that at that age (most) people do not
  have many responsibilities and they also have tons of energy to work
  16 hour days.
</p>
<p>
  In fact I think that learning with open courseware and creating your
  startup simultaneously is better than doing a degree in CS or IT.
  But that is a different story.  :-)
</p>
<p>
  What you say about training sessions in these companies is spot on.
  I have conducted many corporate training sessions and my general
  observation is that most participants treat it as relaxation time.
  Basically it is time to spend away from real work where they will
  learn a bit and generally spend time on chat and email.
</p>
<p>
  Great blog, by the way.  Your blog is going in my blog reader.  :-)

  Agree on all your points.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Training is given by companies not to train people, but to bond
      them.  In India, it's illegal for companies to bond employees
      (bonded labors or slavery was abolished centuries ago), so they
      train saying training costs 2,00,000 INR and you should pay it
      back if you leave within two years.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Engineering: What you study in India in "engineering" colleges
      is not engineering.  After working for three years, I did my
      postgraduate education in Singapore.  Education in Singapore
      focusses only on your ability to understand concepts.  Exams
      have just 2 to 3 questions in total and you have 3 hours of time
      to answer them.  You have to think and write the answer in the
      exam hall.  They make you think.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is an example question from our exam in Singapore:
      "Scenario 1: An employee working with you on a project suddenly
      expresses his intention to quit.  With your knowledge of human
      resource management, how will you convince him to stay with
      you."  An equivalent question from an Indian university would
      look like this: "Briefly explain the ten techniques of employee
      retention.  (10 marks)"
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      I wrote about our education standard 4 years ago:

      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Culture: Are you aware that some project managers expect money
      or high value gadgets in return for sending their subordinates
      onsite?  Even more ugly press-unfriendly things happen with
      female employees.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      This is the exact reason why I am in a foreign land.  Not
      everyone loves to be in a foreign country.  In fact, most don't.
      But we don't have a choice.

  I do not work in any of these organisations but I feel one should
  understand the difference between service industry and product
  industry.  Both are different ball games and both the industries
  cannot survive without each other.  SAP, for example, develops its
  products but various organisations implement it according to the
  need of the clients.  This is very business specific and requires
  analytical and logical decisions along with a lot of engineering
  concepts.
</p>
<p>
  My question to Susam: What would you call an employee working in a
  steel plant's floor where most of the work is automated and a so
  called engineer just monitors the process?  He still is called an
  engineer inspite of being involved in none of the engineering
  activities.
</p>
<p>
  By the way, the Oxford dictionary meaning of engineering might help:
  "The application of scientific and mathematical principles to
  practical ends such as the design, manufacture, and operation of
  efficient and economical structures, machines, processes, and
  systems."
</p>
<p>
  So what you are talking about is just a difference between a good
  engineer and a bad engineer.

<p>
  You asked me:
</p>
<blockquote>

  where most of the work is automated and a so called engineer just
  monitors the process?
</blockquote>
<p>
  I am not sure how this is related to my blog post.  I am talking
  about software engineering only in this blog post.  Perhaps this
  question is a rhetorical one.  In case it isn't, here is what I have
  got to say.
</p>
<p>
  If an engineering graduate cannot use his engineering knowledge to
  solve a problem where there are well known engineering concepts and
  techniques known to solve the problem, such a person probably should
  not be called or hired as an engineer.
</p>
<p>
  Since such people are plenty in Infosys, TCS, and Wipro, I believe a
  young engineer would learn less in these companies than they would
  by joining startups and companies with a strong engineering culture
  such as Adobe, Microsoft, etc.

  Hi,
</p>
<p>
  You just read my mind completely.  I am actually one of those kind
  of people who joined Infosys without any clue and then after 1.7
  years, a few days ago, I sent my resignation.
</p>
<p>
  To add to the usual misery, they exploit employees!  Managers order
  us to come on weekends and stay late nights as if they are
  commanders!  I have never listened to them, so my name is always on
  the hit list.  :)
</p>
<p>
  Many people who are so dedicated and committed are wasting their
  time 14-15 hours in office for the low salaries these people pay!
  With the same dedication, they can reach heights if they were in
  some other better company.  But they are afraid.  They want
  security, the biggest disease in India right now!

<p>
  A really interesting blog post indeed.  Here are a few points I
  would like to put forward.  Also please bear in mind, I in no way
  endorse any of the firms.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Software industry by its own nature is really young.  The
      compliance regulations and processes are not so filtered, at
      least as of now, to be called engineering.  Most of the
      engineers in India are lured by the instant gratification, i.e.,
      good salaries, onsite travel, etc., rather than learning.  The
      services sector provides a good platform to launch one's career.
      I am talking purely from an average engineer's point of view.
      Even you might agree that very few of us treat engineering
      subjects seriously.  That is why to the unsure and clueless, I
      think these companies provide a platform to launch a career.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Concerning the non-IT/computer science background people, from
      my personal experience, it provides a great learning experience,
      at least the training part.  I was computer illiterate as far as
      programming is concerned.  Whatever I learnt at Infosys was a
      huge help while finding on campus jobs during my masters program
      while writing programs to solve engineering problems during my
      masters (most of which was C++).  I am not trying to blow my own
      trumpet but on the basis of the skills learnt during the
      training (though it used to be only 3-5 days per language), I
      managed to learn new stuff, keep myself updated and later apply
      the same while taking part in competitions organized by software
      giants like Microsoft.  It also depends on personal motivation,
      how you learn and later hone it to apply elsewhere.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Now coming to strictly IT/computer science people, even I agree
      if they want to make sense of their field as engineering, then
      they should not join these companies.  Instead, join a small
      product company which designs simple websites but don't get
      dragged into the hell of the software service industry.  If
      onsite travel is what motivates you, then go for higher studies
      instead if your financial conditions are stable and apply for
      jobs at product companies later.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      We are innocent at the age of 21-22, so let us not forget that
      we need to learn by experiencing things ourselves.  From what I
      have learnt in life so far, even a household problem can become
      an engineering one.  A true engineer I think is one who uses
      his/her reasoning to come to conclusions and design solutions
      which best fit the situation by optimizing resources.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Oh and by the way, I joined Infosys because I was mesmerized by
  Narayana Murthy.  I know it was naive but it was worth at least
  trying.
</p>
<p>
  Anyway, I don't want to justify any reasons anyone has for joining
  these firms.  I am just saying its not possible to take the correct
  decisions when you are fresh out of college.  But yes, I would
  rather double-check my motivation to join any company, not just
  these.  That, I think, is possible for everyone.
</p>
<p>
  Your post made me think a lot, so thanks for writing this post.

  Thanks, Susam, for an excellent piece of writing and the follow up
  discussion.
</p>
<p>
  Society gets what society deserve.  Problem does not lie in TCS,
  Infosys, etc.  They are service providers.  Nothing to do with
  engineering.  They built a system where a donkey can win the race
  and bring laurel to his CV, status, family, etc.
</p>
<p>
  You are right in saying that it is not good to be in Infosys, TCS,
  or Wipro if you want to explore engineering.  It is good if you want
  name, fame, money, etc.
</p>
<p>
  Susam, you lose one point though.  Your post confuses a fresh
  engineering graduate about what they should do.  It is not their
  fault.  It is the fault of the system, the seniors, and the elders.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Training: Even big brands provide it, smalls one don't.  It is
      the fault of trainee or trainer or facilitator if the outcome is
      negligible.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Engineering: Who cares at all!  Taking degree matters and
      subsequently job and money.  Education level is at its nadir.
      People can't make Mona Lisa.  They just scan or copy-paste.
      Attitude of society towards scientific stdudies has to be blamed
      for this as they don't encourage students to take
      scientific/engineering challenges.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Engineers: Organisational stucture and policies of these three
      companies can turn so called engineers into great IT brains of
      India.  Ha ha.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Culture: They become earner after joining any organisation.
      They got freedom to do anything up to any level.  Level of
      intensity may differ but the situation is grave.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Onsite: Knowledge and skill does not determine who will travel
      onsite.  Only approach matters and internal politics.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Hats off to Susam and other participants of this lively discussion.

  There is a very interesting pattern in the long debate in the
  comments here.
</p>
<p>
  The people who disagree with this article are either still working
  in one of these three companies or they have never worked in one of
  these three companies.
</p>
<p>
  Those who have worked in one of these three companies and then left
  it to join a better company are the ones who agree with the article
  in their comments.

  There are two implications of this pattern.  Those who disagree with
  this article have seen only one side of the software industry.
  Those who agree with this article have seen both sides of the

  I have to disagree with your tone of trying to guide all.  :) Let us
  say that your brand of engineering is trying to answer core
  problems.  We require both the core and the periphery problems
  answered.  Exactly why we have fewer of the likes of Google and more
  of Infosys.  Although I have my personal preferences that slant with
  your views, philosophically, your answer is not exactly correct.

  I too have a similar story.  I worked in Infosys for 2 years, got
  caught in the bureaucracy, and then the only option to get out of
  the vicious circle was to quit.  I left Infosys to join a startup.
  I promised myself that I would never work for Infosys or a similar
  company again.

<p>
  You have missed the point of this blog post.  Let me clarify it once
  again.  This blog post is not about whether we require both
  engineering and non-engineering problems or why we have fewer
  companies like Google and more like Infosys.
</p>
<p>
  This blog post is about which company young engineers should join so
  that they can make better use of their time at work and learn more
  engineering.

<p>
  The commenters who said that they have met some good engineers in
  these companies, I have a question for them.  This blog post says
  that the number of engineers is very less in these companies.  What
  do you think is wrong here?  There are some good engineers but there
  are many bad engineers.  So it is possible that you had colleagues
  who were well respected but the majority of colleagues in Infosys,
  TCS, and Wipro are not like that.
</p>
<p>
  I worked in one of these companies and I will tell you what kind of
  things happen in these companies.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      People insult each other in bulletin board.  I am not kidding.
      This is true.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Guys leave useless and flirtatious comments on blogs of girls in
      the internal blogs.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      You have to compulsorily stay 9.5 hours in office every day even
      if you have no work.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      In many projects there is no system of code review.  How will
      engineers learn from their mistakes without code review?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      File check-in is done not using standard client side tools but
      some crappy software created by the internal IT team.  The
      crappy software is an interface between CVS and desktop.  You
      have to reserve names for new files you have created one by one,
      then upload them one by one, upload each modified file one by
      one via a web-based interface.  It takes roughly 3 hours to
      check in just 10 files.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  I agree with the author that these companies have one of the worst
  cultures.
</p>
<p>
  I started my career here and after that I worked in 3 more different
  companies.  All the three were better than these companies.  At
  least I can check in code properly where I am now.  At least I can
  disagree with other people in company bulletin board without fearing
  that someone will abuse me or insult me.  Infosys, TCS, or Wipro is
  an absolutely bad place to start your career if your aim is to learn
  good programming, learn good work culture, and gain good knowledge
  from good colleagues.

  Kalyan Suri, Narayan Babu, etc.
</p>
<p>
  I have one simple question to you people who are commenting that
  fresh engineering graduates should join Infosys, TCS, or Wipro.
  Why?  You guys are not giving any good reason that is important to
  us.  You guys are simply giving only philosophy like someone can
  join Infosys and similar companies to change the system, improve its
  culture and engineering practices, service work is also important
  with product work, etc.
</p>
<p>
  Fresh engineering graduates like us are not interested in
  philosophy.  We want to use our knowledge, do good work, and earn
  money.
</p>
<p>
  Why should they join a company to change the system and improve the
  culture of the company?  Are they social reformers?  Are they the
  managers of these companies?  Should they rebel against the CEOs and
  the HRs of these companies to create a new culture?
</p>
<p>
  I am just not able to understand why you guys are asking that
  someone should join these companies and work with people who don't
  know how to do proper engineering and force you to follow software
  practices?
</p>
<p>
  In short you guys tell me why any fresh graduate should join a
  company to do all these philosophical and cultural improvements
  instead of trying to join a company where they can do proper
  engineering work, learn good coding and engineering practices from
  senior engineers, and also earn more money.

  I agree with the author.  I am new to the industry and got placed in
  a company similar to these three (don't want to mention the name).
  These guys have recruited such people in campus that they do not
  deserve being called engineers at all.  Kudos to the post.

  Quite impressed by your article.  What you have written is the
  reality.  That is what is happening in these so called IT firms.  A
  bulk of fresh talent is being wasted in the air-conditioned offices
  of these firms.  Nowadays, good stuff is available on the Internet
  and social networking websites about the work in these IT firms
  which helps software job aspirants to take right decisions for their
  future.  I have the same suggestion to all the job aspirants: Dont
  run in the rat race.  Just choose the job that is in accordance with
  your skill, so that you can get an opportunity to explore and
  enhance it.

  Very nice post.  I second the thought that IT companies are wasting
  loads of talent by hiring then and utilizing them as mere resources.
  But the flip side to this is that the young talented IT folks should
  also realize this.  They have to take control of their careers.  If
  they are focused enough, IT companies should just be a part of the
  journey, not the destination.

  @Susam, You rocked in this post!  I am a second year student and
  having almost no knowledge about the environment in these companies,
  I was shocked.  I already knew that they make you work like peasants
  but other points you mentioned were completely new to me.

  There is a huge misconception about the software industry in India,
  especially among Indians.  That misconception is that the software
  companies like the ones you mentioned above employ smart people and
  that their main business proposition is that they make the Indian
  "talent" pool available to clients overseas.  The fact is, these
  companies help fill up the clerical jobs that are just too expensive
  to do at the client's end.
</p>
<p>
  The British designed our education system to produce clerks.  We are
  continuing their good work and companies like the ones above are
  filling their coffers by making use of this pool of clerks.  They do
  a great job of glorifying the work which they give to their
  employees, by giving them glass buildings to sit in and providing
  them with a conducive environment to meet their future spouse, so
  that it creates a better lock-in.

  Nice post.  Your post is depicting the reality.  Unfortunately, the
  people working in these organizations run away from the truth.  It
  reminds me of the classic case of ostrich which tries to hide its
  face from the hunter.  Let me introduce myself.  I have an
  experience of 5 years in the IT industry.  I have worked in Infosys.
  Your descriptio of these companies is absolutely right.
</p>
<p>
  In my first organization (not Infosys), I started facing
  discrimination from my manager who was an electrical engineer.  She
  was totally useless.  She had never heard of Norton's theorem.  I
  quit that organization and landed in Infosys.
</p>
<p>
  Infosys was a nightmare for me.  Half of the people there could not
  construct proper sentences in email communication.  None of them did
  any engineering.  Calling these people engineers is nothing but
  disrespect to the word "engineer".  These people didn't even know
  the difference between HTML and XML.  The middle managers are too
  bossy and too arrogant.  They turn the lives of employees into a
  nightmare.

<p>
  Continuing from my previous comment.
</p>
<p>
  There are some trolls commenting here and defending these companies.
  I want to tell them to please stop calling themselves engineers.
  The title which is appropriate for such people is "softicians", just
  like "technicians".
</p>
<p>
  The type of emotive responses these commenters are posting come from
  people who know the reality but are hiding away from the facts.
  This blog post is truly accurate.  You will not find any engineering
  happening in these organizations.  If someone has to be an engineer,
  he would use all the formal methods of engineering.  In computer
  science, it includes modelling, finite automata, performance
  measurement, etc.  Such things do not happen in these organizations.
</p>
<p>
  If you are interested in engineering, better to go to some
  organization where engineering actually happens.

<p>
  Personal experience: Did a contract in Germany and part of the
  solution involved working with Infosys guys.  They were "cheap" and
  a dime a dozen.
</p>
<p>
  Infosys focuses on quantity rather than quality.  A great deal of
  the time they'll ship over many developers to do 1 developer's job.
  At the same time they'll ship over an organizer who is responsible
  for coordinating with the Infosys guys - like an onsite PM, except
  without any power.
</p>
<p>
  The guys we dealt with were all terrible communicators, just there
  for the money, and not very skilled.  They constantly over
  engineered solutions, and gave a lot of "It's not possible" answers.
</p>
<p>
  The actual product we worked with was Remedy, and I have to say it
  was a joke.  Extremely cumbersome, most likely built by the same
  sort of monkeys we had to deal with.

  All in all, it's not an experience I want to repeat.

  Susam,
</p>
<p>
  I understand where you are coming from.  We need to realise that
  these IT companies are businesses whose stock is people (like
  toothpaste is stock for Hindustan Lever).  You have stock in various
  levels of finish.  Some might be work in progress (in training).
  Some might be ready-to-sell.  And the business will always take good
  care of the stock (making sure the toothpaste stays at the right
  temperature for example), so they can sell the stock (market the
  skillset).
</p>
<p>
  Big IT firms treat its employees like cattle and no one realises it
  because the cattle is well fed and the butchering (of talent and
  free thinking) happens over a period of 20-30 years.

  Hi Susam,
</p>
<p>
  I went through your article and couldn't agree more on most counts.
  When I completed my studies and 90% of my batchmates were placed in
  swanky air-conditioned offices with pretty girls around in good
  cities, I always wondered what went wrong with me.  But soon, in 5
  years of time, I realised what most of these software professionals
  do: cribbing, cribbing, and cribbing, all the time!
</p>
<p>
  No offense meant to anyone but trust me when I say that I started my
  career in a very hard way.  Today, having woked in Volvo and being
  in Hyundai, I can tell you that most of the software professionals
  start living in such a small shell that they get very easily worked
  up by real life obstacles.  I mean their lives becomes so small:
  bitcing about collegues, gossips, pretty girls and onsite travel.
  Is this what we were meant to be while we were students?
</p>
<p>
  As for the engineering part, Susam, even for me who is in a full
  fledged proper technology company I must say it is challenging to do
  what you really want because you always have to balance between what
  you want and the money you need to survive and how you get it.  But
  on the whole, a good observation.

  It completely depends on the personal interest of the individual.
  There are a lot of open source communities to showcase engineering
  talent.  But for making money, your need to work somewhere initially
  in companies like TCS.  I believe talent without money is useless.
  There are many people who started their career in TCS and went to
  Google by showcasing their talent in open source communities.

  @Susam, Absolutely correct.  People who disagree belong to one of
  these categories:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Managers in Infosys, TCS, Wipro, etc.</li>
  <li>Those planning to write GRE/GMAT/CAT.</li>
  <li>People who need to get their heads examined.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  There is no fourth category.
</p>
<p>
  For people who really want to do good work and want to find great
  ppl to work with, I am presenting a list of companies in a
  categorized manner below.  I hope it helps CS/IT graduates.  This
  list is based on my interactions with friends and colleagues
  regarding the places where they work.  In the list below, product
  based startups fall between levels A+ and B.  Here is the list:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Level A+: Google, IBMRL, HP Research, Zynga, and RSA.  These are
      the best places to be in.  This is where the most talented
      engineers work.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Level A: Intuit, Microsoft, Yahoo, Amazon, and Flipkart.
      Sometimes the work is really of A+ level but sometimes it is
      not.  I know many will disagree but some of the folks from these
      companies will agree.  This is where the cream of the talent is.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Level B: Thoughtworks and Robosoft.  These are difficult to get
      into but not as difficult as those in levels A+ and A.  They are
      not always engineering focussed.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Level C: Aditi, Persistent, and any outsourced product
      development companies.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Level D: Dell, Verizon, Qwest, Bank of America, and any US
      company which does not sell software but sells phone lines,
      credit cards, etc.  The auality of work is same as Infosys, TCS,
      and Wipro but there is some chance that you might meet someone
      intelligent here.  Pay is slightly better than Infosys, TCS, and
      Wipro.  This should be the second last resort.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Level E: Infosys, TCS, Wipro, Cognizant, HCL, IGATE, Patni, HP,
      Sonata, Covansys, Accenture, and IBM.  These are the worst.  You
      can send your mother-in-law to work here.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  In all of these companies, Patni is probably the worst.

  Hi,

  I work for Accenture and while the culture and software practices
  seem to be better, overall we don't work on any real computer
  science problems.  If you didn't have an algorithm or puzzle round
  in your selection process, be assured you aren't going to face any
  computer science problem there.
</p>
<p>
  I knew what piece of cake I was getting for what price.  I go to
  office, have 9 easy hours and comeback with a salary that will
  support me till the time I jump into the real race!  That being
  said, I know, I am not an engineer because I don't do anything new.
  But I am a smart graduate who earns 30,000 INR per month without
  deserving it!

  I agree with your post.  If you really want to make your career path
  strong, then small companies are very good for freshers.  The reason
  behind it is that those companies provide complete exposure to all
  the employees.  You are included in all the phases of software
  construction, so your knowledge and skills increase.  Obviously,
  then you can switch to any MNCs which have their own advantages like
  higher salaries.

  My pedantic contribution.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Yes, I can learn a useful amount of a typical programming
      language in three days.  That doesn't mean Haskell, but it does
      (and did) mean Pascal, Modula 2, Ada, C, C++, Java and C# among
      others.  Usually, that mostly means how to spell the same old
      concepts, with very few new semantic ideas.  The new semantic
      ideas can often be considered "special purpose", and can best be
      learned later, as needed to do the job.  Learning the first
      three days worth in a training course (or from videos) is useful
      because it's just so damn boring - paying attention throughout
      the whole thing is impossible, so you need the training to carry
      on while you're 90% asleep or else you never finish.  10% awake
      is more than enough.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Regular expressions can test for balanced parentheses.  They can
      even test for any depth of balanced parentheses, so long as you
      know the finite maximum depth you need to test for when you
      construct the regex.  I don't claim it's practical (context-free
      grammars and push-down automata exist for a reason, even though
      most nesting isn't that deep in the real world), but this isn't
      a sane argument, it's pedantry.  ;-)
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<!-- date: 2011-12-06 06:11:31 +0000 -->

<p>
  Good points Steve but remember that you need to be fairly interested
  in programming and technology to pick up a new language in 3 days of
  training.  Most programmers I meet in the software industry aren't
  so interested.  Those who are and have the ability to pick up a new
  language in 3 days don't work for Indian IT outsourcing firms.  :-)
  So the first point of the author is still valid.  Those who can pick
  up a new language in 3 days should stay away from these companies.
</p>
<p>
  If you really want to be pedantic, you shouldn't assume that an
  upper-bound to the depth of nested parentheses is known.
  Perl-derived regular expressions which support a lot of fancy
  features including recursive patterns can solve the problem for an
  arbitrary depth of nested parentheses but they are not true regular
  expressions.  They are extensions to formal regular expressions.
  Moreover, POSIX BREs are incapable of handling recursive patterns
  and they cannot test for balanced parentheses.

  As a US citizen with a "name brand" PhD in Engineering, I can assure

  Yeah, pushdown automata should be used to detect balanced set of

  automata.

  I totally agree with the author of this post.  I have a master's
  degree in computer science from the University Of Calcutta.  I had a
  university rank in both of my bachelor's degree studies and master's
  degree studies.  I am working in one of these three companies.  I
  have done three months of training in the company.  I have not seen
  a single line of code so far.  I have done my training well and I
  got to learn a lot but what I am doing now and will continue to do
  for the next two months is translating some documents from one
  language to another.  I am also supposed to do some support work (no
  software developement at all) and although I have no work to do, I
  have to sit in front of my machine for 9 hours a day.  This is an
  unproductive use of a person who has researched on "Distributed file
  system and parallel computing" in her final semester.
</p>
<p>
  My seniors who are not all from CS/IT background, felt that it is
  very easy to learn any pogramming language in 3 days.  I guess what
  they meant by "learning" is learning only the syntax of the
  language.
</p>
<p>
  I am very upset as I can't utilise my knowledge and can't learn
  anything except some syntax.  I want to leave this job and want to
  sudy hard for getting into research.  Maybe I have to stay
  unemployed for a long period.  My family and I can afford it now but
  it's not possible for every individual.  I have to turn myself away
  from all the luxury I've been used to for the past six months.  But
  I want to do something which is relevant to what I've studied and
  learnt.  Being creative at my heart, I can't do this support job
  anymore.
</p>
<p>
  My advice to all the fresh engineering graduates who want to do
  something in engineering and doesn't need money immediately is to
  wait and think before you join one of these companies.

  My opinion on the points you have made in this post:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Training: Organizations have to show evidence of training to
      their clients to get projects.  It has nothing to do with
      providing knowledge to engineers.  You can't feed software
      engineering into any individual in 3 months which normally takes
      4 years to imbibe.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Engineering: It depends on luck whether you get a good project
      which truly tests your engineering skills or not.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Engineers: It's not the company's fault that they do not have
      many engineers.  It is the institutions in which they studied
      that couldn't produce engineers.  Not everyone has the
      capability to become an engineer.  If the institutions aren't
      right, even the brightest could fail.  Good institutions can
      make the dullest shine.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Culture: It depends on your circle of people who you work with.
      You will always find the culture about which you complain.  Even
      small companies try to get the most out of you, make you work
      overnight, weekdays, ask you to keep your mobiles off, do not
      let you access internet, etc.  Small companies do not have the
      best culture but they are not the worst.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Onsite: I agree with what you have said about this.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  I worked with Infosys 3 years ago.  I have also worked at client
  side with Cisco and Microsoft.  I currently run my own small
  software company in my hometown.  After working in all these
  companies, I came to the same conclusion as yours for the question,
  "Infosys, TCS, or Wipro?"  My answer too is, "None."
</p>
<p>
  For guys and girls who read Susam's post and then took the pain to
  read this comment, do not worry if you are not able to get into one
  of these MNCs or if you do not get what you deserve, be it in terms
  of project or salary.  There are many small software companies out
  there which apply engineering.  Go for it.  Don't worry about the
  pay.  Think what would happen to you if you are put into some
  bullshit maintenance project for a year doing some mere repetitive
  stuff.  Your mind would accumulate rust.  When the project is over
  or you switch companies, you will no longer able to perform the way
  you could have when you were a fresher.  In case you feel stuck in a
  project, take a bold decision and inform your manager to switch to
  another.  Yes, you can shout and you can pick the project you want.

</p>

<p>
  It is true that the culture depends on the circle of people who we
  work with but it is not true that we will always find such bad
  culture elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
  I started my career in Infosys and truly the culture was abysmal.  I
  did see employees attacking each other personally with profane
  language in the internal corporate forums.  After I left Infosys, I
  have worked for many other product companies.  I have not found such

  I blame these companies for creating standardized tests as a barrier
  to entry, and for becoming reliant on these tests to sort potential
  employees.  Worse, I was floored when I came across the concept of
  "placement papers" which appear to be prevalent in India.
  Unbelievable!
</p>
<p>
  If a company hands you a standardized test in your field of study,
  it says a lot about that company.  (Unable to judge talent.  Blind
  to the fact that their tests are being gamed.)  It says a lot about
  their confidence in your education.  (Is the diploma worth
  something, or does it just say that you've gone through the
  motions?)  And if a job seeker goes along with it, it says a lot
  about them, too.  (You really want a job and can't do better.  You
  went to a school that a company doesn't trust, and you're willing to
  work for a company that is demonstrating to you that it is poor with
  cultivating talent.)

  I have worked for a decade in TCS and longer in the industry
  overall.  I would like to post a more inclusive response to this
  issue.
</p>
<p>
  The fact that 300,000 people are working in a functioning
  organization is indeed commendable.  They win projects worth
  hundreds of millions of dollars, add value to customers, and create
  skilled workers in the industry.  Let's give them the due credit as
  well.
</p>
<p>
  Having said that, these companies are definetely not for the best
  brains.  The poor salaries they offer attract poor talent.  For
  example, Google offered 197,000 dollars to IIT Kharagpur students
  during campus placement.  That is close to 1 crore rupees.  TCS also
  went to the same campus and offered only 3 lakh rupees of salary.
  :)
</p>
<p>
  But some exceptionally smart engineers do end up joining these low
  paying companies and hate these organizations, their culture, work
  practices, and opportunities for development.  This is a hard
  reality of the Indian IT services companies.
</p>
<p>
  I agree with most of the points that the blogger has made in this
  post.  Forget about engineering, they go and recruit
  B.Com./B.Sc./Dilpoma degree holders and employ them as software
  engineers.  The bottom line is if you are a serious engineer, look
  for another job.  Don't get stuck doing data entry in the Indian IT
  services companies.
</p>
<p>
  The most demeaning part about working in these companies is indeed
  the culture and the senior employees who never deserved to reach
  their positions and draw 25 to 30 lakh rupees of salary.  They are
  producing demeaning human values in these companies.  They are not
  involved in any productive work.  I am saying this from my first
  hand experience.
</p>
<p>
  An open message to any CEO who is reading these comments.  It is
  easy to replace a good worker but it is very difficult to go back to
  a good culture after it is spoilt.  Right now the rotting culture of
  these companies is going to an abyss with no possibility of return.

  I joined TCS thinking it to be a great Tata company and continued
  there for a decade.  The company has detiorated to rock bottom.  Let
  me be absolutely candid here.  It is a place for below average
  people, who are weak technically, lack ethics, can easily compromise
  with their values, and fear proper competitive firms.  As a result,
  after few years you find yourself in the middle of highly
  manipulative and insecure people who are not just incompetent but
  morally degraded as well.
</p>
<p>
  My advice to all young engineers is to work hard, target a smaller
  (even a startup) company and do something good for their future.
  There is nothing left in the "Tata" name of "Tata Consultancy
  Services".  TCS is now good for BPO/BPS executives, not for
  engineers who want to solve engineering problems, create solutions,
  and build something good for their customers, their country, or even
  themselves.

  Well said!  I'm glad there are people who think like me.  It is six
  years after you wrote this post.  This looks more like a prophecy
  now.  With all the H1B visa curbs by Trump, we can see engineers
  switching to companies that offer them more value.  We hardly
  innovate anything in this country.  We need more contributions from
  engineers now more than ever.  It's time for Indian software
  engineers to innovate and contribute something significantly.

  Your post was an excellent read and helped me navigate companies
  when I graduated.  I knew what to avoid and that saved me a lot of
  time and effort.  Thank you,keep 'em coming.
