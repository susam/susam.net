Susam,
</p>
<p>
Nice blog post! But it looks like you are discrediting many people
working in these companies by your blog post. Let me clarify.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      About the training sessions, whose fault is it that the trainees
      absorb only 1% of the knowledge? If the trainees are good enough,
      they can always learn the stuff taught without problems. Anyway,
      the organization you are referring to where a programming language
      is taught in 3 days might be the only one doing it. The
      organization I work for trained us in an application for many days
      with a thorough syllabus. And when our organization tried to train
      people on different programming languages quickly, it was assumed
      that they would know pretty much of that already because of their
      engineering studies or because they were picked from the best
      institutions like NIT, IIT, etc. So they probably do assume that
      since these trainees are getting paid more and are from better
      colleges, their ability to grasp new things would be much higher
      than the rest. Anyway, this is just my viewpoint, just like the
      blog post is your viewpoint.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      What do you mean by engineering? The only engineering I hear about in
      these companies is in the field of Product Engineering (and maybe where
      they use VLSI and stuff). But this is a small sector of these
      organizations. They have many more sectors where the requirement
      is to fulfill the client's requirements. As simple as that. Be it
      providing a service like administration or create new
      applications. But seldom are people told to "create" products for
      companies, especially the BFSI sector which is primarily one of
      the highest revenue earners for these organizations.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      I myself work in data warehousing and don't have anything to do
      with creating Products or writing millions lines of code. But we
      are directly interfaced with business. We create critical
      applications for the client using our ETL tools. So is this work
      bad? Is this work something that engineers aren't supposed to be
      doing? Then who is supposed to be doing this? And do note that
      this job requires very high analytical skills which engineers
      should have in them.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Culture: Well, I can agree on some points that you made. But you
      cannot classify the whole organization into this. What do you mean
      when you say these people are "software-tailors"? Aren't these
      professionals building something for someone? Are you saying that
      anybody who can browse the internet and knows about computers can
      do our jobs? Don't you think we would find that a bit insulting?
      It might be true in many cases where the proper training can make
      a monkey do our jobs, but isn't that true for many fields? Aren't
      monkeys being trained to pilot airships?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Onsite: I won't comment on this since I am onsite. But do know
      this that there is a chance that someone might actually like the
      way business is done onsite and the work culture out here. And
      yes, money is a big factor. Will you say that a poor man's son who
      is in onsite earning money for his family is greedy? So its all
      about perception. So the picture isn't always black and white my
      friend. You need to factor in everyone's needs and desires.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
Anyway, no offense to you or your blog post. Just wanted to point out
that everyone's perception is different. Since you do not work with any
of these companies now, its easy to be outside and comment. But I've
been with my organization for quite some time now and I feel absolutely
fine with that. Anyways, thank you for an opportunity for a healthy
debate.

<p>
Sambeet,
</p>
<p>
This blog post is not about why the training is not effective or whether
monkeys are being trained to pilot airships. This blog post answers the
question, "Infosys, TCS, or Wipro?" The answer I choose is:
<em>"None."</em>
</p>
<p>
Your second point allows the possibility that the work can be done by a
high school student with a crash course on software and that is
precisely what these companies do, but with engineering graduates. I
didn't see any mention or hint of a concrete engineering problem in your
second point that requires engineering skill or knowledge. Perhaps,
"engineering" means different things to both of us.
</p>
<p>
Building things isn't a proof of being engineers. Building things like
engineers is. Your fourth point also demonstrates how the employees of
these companies convince themselves that they are professional engineers
just because they can create a working software. Sadly, the fact is that
people of these companies build software in a manner some school kid
with no knowledge of programming or engineering would do.
</p>
<p>
In your point fifth point, you seem to agree that going onsite is less about
one's technical prowess and passion for engineering. So what you are
saying here is consistent with what I am saying in my blog post.

@Sambeet, Isn't that true? In my last 1.5 years in infosys, I have not
done a single work which required me to use any engineering skill. All I
do is write JavaScript to take care of user input. You call that
engineering?

I work for a client of TCS. So, I have to post as an anonymous coward
due to legal reasons. :] I am quite alarmed by Sambeet's response,
especially his 5th point, where he writes that the Indian vendors send
their employees to work on client's site not because they are proficient
in technology but because you need to factor in everyone's needs and
desiers. Excuse me! We need good technology people. Why can't you guys
just be professional and keep your personal lives and poverty aside
while discussing technology?

Great post, Susam! But I disagree that startups are a good place to get
real engineering work where we can use our engineering knowledge. Many
startups in India also do only "sofware-tailor" type of job. but I agree
that there are good startups also where we can get good engineering
problems to work on. Freshers should always choose a startup over
Infosys, Wipro, or TCS if they want to learn useful things.
</p>
<p>
Sambeet, you asked:
</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>
I will say, yes. If you are talking about software like crappy SBI bank
sofware or ICICI bank software which cannot run reliably all the time,
keeps crashing at the drop of a hat, then yes anbody who can browse the
internet and knows about computer and a little bit programming can do
your jobs.

<p>
Well, with due respect to you opinions, I will share mine.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Absorbing the knowledge shared in training is the responsibility
      of the employee. And definitely more than 1% get this knowledge.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Engineering does happen. More than what we have learnt in school
      and college. While we learn theory at college, here you solve real
      world business problems.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      People who work are well qualified for the job. Some are much more
      qualified than an Engineer - a CA, a MBA, a PhD, etc. - and
      sharing your work space with these guys does broaden your
      spectrum.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      As for culture, it is we the people who build it. It is a sum of
      parts - with each of us being a part.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      As for onsite travel, it is based on various factors.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
All in all, things are not as bad as perceived.

<p>
Hey Susam,
</p>
<p>
Saw this debate going on and couldn't help but jump in. Before I start,
let me point out a couple of ground realities:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      All the three companies you named self-confess that they work in
      the "services" domain. There is no mention of "engineering"
      anywhere.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      These are mass recruiters. They recruit people who don't have a
      chance of joining google or RSA just out of college.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Having said that, I come back to the question you asked. My take would
be joining these companies is good in two cases:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      You love computers and like solving real world problems using
      computers. But you don't have a degree from the heavy weight
      colleges, so don't have a chance in the biggies of the industry.
      Get in these companies, use them as a launchpad and get ahead in
      your life.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      You don't know anything about computers, but want to earn a decent
      white-collar living. Get into these companies, get set for your
      life.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
I don't think there is any third category of people joining these or
rather any other company in the industry.
</p>
<p>
I rest my case. :)

<p>
Paritosh,
</p>
<p>
Regarding using these companies as launchpad, I am not quite getting it.
In fact, if you study in a not so good college and work in these
companies for 5+ years, your resume is worthless and you cannot launch
yourself anywhere. I worked for 2.5 years in one of these companies (in
addition to having a degree from a not so good college) and from my
personal experience I can say for sure that it only adds one more hurdle
to jump if at all you manage to launch a career later.

@Vyankatesh, Err... What? You've got CAs, MBAs in Infosys, Wipro, and TCS
and so it broadens your spectrum? You think CAs and MBAs don't exist in
better companies? And what has the presence of CAs and MBAs have to do
with engineering? It is funny that people from these companies who are
coming to this blog post to defend their employers are making matters
worse and showing us how sorry the state of these companies are. The
people defending these companies in these comments have not worked in a
company where real engineering work happens and so do not even know what
they are talking about.

<p>
Paritosh,
</p>
<p>
I think starting a career in Infosys, TCS, or Wipro is a very bad way of
starting a career. Sambeet and Vyankatesh are the biggest examples of
why it is a bad way to make a career. After they stay in these companies
they become institutionalized. Their outlook of the technology world
becomes so narrow that they believe whatever they are doing is
engineering and everywhere it is like this. They are not in a position
to even accept that their work is something that does not need
engineering graduates. Anyone with internet connection can do that work.
It is because of this that people like these cannot get out of these
companies and remain stuck in these companies forever only to come and
post in blog posts like this and mislead general public when someone
tries to expose the truths about these companies to the outside world.
No real technology company would like to hire people with such narrow
outlook.
</p>
<p>
I very much agree with Prunthaban that once you stay in these companies
for a few years, your resume is screwed because every technology giant
knows what kind of crap these companies hire.
</p>

I have led a project where we interacted with one of the three companies
mentioned in this article. One thing I can say for sure that there is no
such thing as a good engineer in these companies. They were supposed to
deliver a project in 3 months' time. Not only did they lack severely
in technical skills, they handled the project very unprofessionally and
their behavior showed complete lack of integrity.
</p>
<p>
Deadlines were missed, delivery was delayed and even after the delay,
the delivery was not functional. There were numerous bugs which showed a
basic lack of understanding of the system among the developers.
Deadlocks in databases were common and when we filed a ticket we
realized that the engineers lacked a basic understanding of what kind of
operations lead to deadlocks.
</p>
<p>
Despite being clearly spelled out in the document that the software must
make use of multithreading to take advantage of the multicore servers we
use, we did not find performance improvements when we increased the
number of threads. We expected linear improvement in the performance
with the increase in the number of threads. They kept insisting that
they had multithreading in the software but our analysis contradicted
their claims. We had to escalate the matter and asked them to rewrite
the multithreading code. The most ironic part of the whole affair was
that our engineers had to work with their engineers and supervise them
to get the multithreading part done correctly. After such a horrible
experience I can very confidently confirm that the third point in this
blog post about the lack of true engineers in these organizations is
100% true.

<p>
@Prunthaban, Vamsi, et al.,
</p>
<p>
When people say working in these companies for 5+ years makes your
resume is worthless and you cannot launch yourself anywhere, I feel they
are hiding behind excuses. You don't need a great company to write
beautiful code. What you need is belief in yourself and basic analytical
and logical abilities.
</p>
<p>
Lots of people have come out from these companies and gone to write
great code. I personally know a few. Heck, even the author of this post
used one of these so called crappy companies to launch his career (sorry
Susam for bringing this up).
</p>
<!-- date: 2011-05-16 04:19:45 +0000 -->
<!-- name: Prunthaban -->
<!-- url: https://twitter.com/pruntz -->
<p>
Paritosh,
</p>
<p>
I think you have misunderstood me. I am not saying people who work in
these companies will always write crappy code :-) I worked in one of
these companies for 2.5 years and I have met/seen great coders
(including the author of this post as you rightly said). These people
are great coders because they used their extra-time to learn stuff. But
a good engineering company will make you learn all this the easier way
through your day to day job itself (How many times you get the chance to
see a piece of code written by really great coders with 20+ years of
experience in one of these mentioned companies?).
</p>
<p>
My point is that when a person working in these companies decide to
launch a different career, these companies in your resume makes it
'one more hurdle' to jump. I am not saying it is impossible. I
am only saying that having these companies do hinder your progress. I
spent 2.5 years and I can say with confidence that if I had spent that
2.5 years in some other engineering company I would have been in an even
better position. I am sure that applies to Susam too.

<p>
You mentioned:
</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>
I did start my career in one of these three companies I've mentioned in
the title of this post. But it is a negative point rather than a
positive point in my resume. It didn't help me at all when I went to
interview with RSA. What helped though were the reading and
application-security related projects I did late at nights after
spending 9 to 10 hours daily at work. I got the job at RSA.
</p>
<p>
Prunthaban too has a similar story. When he applied to Google, his prior
work experience at one of these three companies turned out to be
useless. However, he had done a lot of hard work in algorithms and
software design area out of his own interest. He used to regularly
participate in Topcoder and CodeChef algorithm contests. Due to his
strong foundation in algorithms and data structures that he had built
out of his own interest in his personal time, he got the job at Google.
</p>
<p>
If I had known what I have shared in this post 5 years ago, I would have
never made the mistake of starting my career in one of these three
companies. As you can see from Prunthaban's comment, he feels the same
way too.

Good post. But I think you should mention that your post is meant for
computer science engineers and their lack of engineering skills because
these organizations are IT/software firms.
</p>
<p>
There are solid points for discussions about why engineers from other
backgrounds get into these firms but as I can see from your post, you
were mostly aiming at IT/CS folks though not explicitly addressed to
them.
</p>
<p>
Startups find it difficult to get fresh engineers as these organizations
do because there is a social aura in favour of these companies more than
anything else.

<p>
Ravishankar,
</p>
<p>
I am not specifically aiming at IT/CS engineers. Some of these companies
need other kinds of engineers too. Unfortunately, no matter what kind of
engineers they are, there knowledge and engineering skills have been
found to be dismal. Some examples from my personal experience:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      An entire team of electronics engineers did not know basic digital
      logic. Hence, they were unable to think of efficient solutions to
      some real world business problems that could be solved in a very
      elegant and efficient manner using digital logic. I have selected
      one of those problems and mentioned it in point 3 of my blog post.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      I have met people with degree in electronics and communications
      engineering in one of these companies who did not know about
      information entropy and hence were unable to take decisions about
      data compression.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      In one of these companies, I have met an electronics engineer who
      configured a circuit incorrectly because he did not know that a
      p-n junction diode requires forward bias to "turn it on". In the
      same company, I have met a couple of computer science engineers
      who did not know that a regular expression cannot be used to match
      strings with balanced parentheses.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Now, these are really basic concepts in the respective engineering
fields. If people who do not know such basic concepts about their fields
are working in good positions (they are sometimes project leads too) in
these companies, it speaks a lot about what kind of engineering these
people must be doing and what kind of software or other non-software
projects these people must be building.
</p>
<p>
We have digressed from the point I've tried to make in this post. I am
not really concerned with the kind of software they are building. I am
concerned what my friends who ask, "Infosys, Wipro, or TCS?", are going
to learn in these companies. My answer to them is, "None", because I
want them to look for a good startup or a reputed technology company
with a good engineering culture known for hiring good engineers where
they can learn how to solve problems efficiently and correctly from
other senior engineers.

Hi Susam,
</p>
<p>
It is really great to see you write this eye-opening article. It helps
two kinds of people. Those who want to ask this question will think
twice before even asking this question. Those who are there sailing in
the boat of these IT companies might realize something and break out
from the shackles of hollowness.

Hi Susam,
</p>
<p>
Great blog post! You have missed one more myth that needs attention.
</p>
<p>
Brand name: Students feel that Infosys, TCS, or Wipro are great brand
names. It is far from the truth. Infosys, TCS, or Wipro are embarrassing
brand names to write in your resume unless you want to join another
Infosys, TCS, Wipro like company such as Cognizant, Accenture, etc.
who are ready to hire any crap that comes out of Infosys, TCS, and Wipro.
Good technology companies know that these brand names are like balloons.
They look big from outside but has nothing apart from gas inside.
Actually an engineer from a good but less popular startup has a better
chance than a person from Infosys to get a job in a big technology
company.

I think all the 5 reasons pertain to the employee rather than the
organisation. I would love to join Infy/Wipro just for the reasons you
have given.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Training: If only 1% make it, I would want to be a part of that
      elite group.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Engineering: Nobody "is" using proper engineering technique does
      not force me to follow them. Why can't I do it the right way?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Engineers: 1:200 is not under my control. A company has the rights
      to choose how many engineers and how many janitors they need. I
      would choose to be an engineer anyways.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Culture: For gossipping or cribbing why do you have to go to
      Infy/Wipros? You can just be a blogger! (pun intended)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Onsite: The so called "engineers" study theories and algorithms
      created by Dijkstras, Adlemans and Tanenbaums. Why wouldn't an
      engineer want to meet people like them?
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
Having said all that I myself am a bootstrapper and run a startup. And I
can tell you that most of the average fresh-out-of-college engineers
wouldn't survive in a startup for the very exact reasons you have given.

It seems to me that you have left your comment for the sole purpose of

experience of what these companies are. However, I'll take it in stride.
:-)
</p>
<p>
Here is what I have got to say for each of your points:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      In my opinion, one should always strive to be in the company of
      engineers who are better because it exposes one to challenging
      problems and ideas on a daily basis. This accelerates the pace of
      learning new concepts severalfold. Yes, one can definitely learn
      through self-study using the internet, books and online friends,
      but the experience of working with a talented and experienced
      senior engineer sitting next to you is priceless. It only adds. I
      don't see how it subtracts.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      You have a very wrong idea about these companies if you believe
      that you are not forced to follow bad software practices in these
      companies.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      I agree that you don't have control on how many good engineers a
      company like Infosys, TCS, or Wipro hires. But you do have control
      to join a different organization which hires good engineers.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The corporate network of any good company is and should be much
      more civil and conducive to development than the internet. In
      these companies the situation is reversed. I don't understand
      what your point about culture is then.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      One does not meet Dijkstras and Adlemans by going onsite. That
      takes a lot more effort than just going onsite. I can tell you
      this from my personal experience. ;-)
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
You also seem to undermine the capabilities of fresh engineering
graduates. Also, it seems like you fail to attract the best
talent. I have interviewed many fresh engineering graduates who
are way better than people with 5 to 10 years of experience in
these three companies. We have no trouble attracting good talent where I
work now. One of the brightest engineers I work with joined straight out
of college last year and now sits next to me.

lesser known startups.

I just want to say that not all engineers plan to go for core jobs while
studying. I was always interested to work in IT but had to get a good
engineering degree to fulfill that dream. It sounds bad but I don't use
my engineering skills at my job. But I've learnt a lot more now and I
use that in my job. And yes, I am proud that I've nothing to do with
"engineering" and am still happy with it.
</p>
<p>
In the end, I guess Susam wanted to highlight that not much engineering
might be happening in these companies. I won't comment on that since I
was never into that field as such. But I do know of many software
engineering patents coming out of these companies so I guess they must
be doing something right. But these companies have never claimed to be
engineering companies and have always been IT services companies. So
Susam is correct in saying that engineers who want to use their
knowledge they gained during engineering should not join these 3
companies. The only thing you need to see is how much percentage of
engineers actually choose to do so.

Hey Susam,
</p>
<p>
I agree with your point. But if no Infosys, no TCS, then where should
new engineers go?
</p>
<p>
Let me tell you, I am a student selected at Infosys and about to join
it.

Hi Susam,
</p>
<p>
You wrote this in the end:
</p>
<blockquote>
An interview is not only an opportunity for an organization to evaluate
an applicant, it is also an opportunity for the applicant to evaluate an
organization.
</blockquote>
<p>
This is exactly true! I was very happy that the interviewer didn't ask
me many technical questions when I went to interview for one of these
three companies. Now I am feeling the heat.
</p>
<p>
I would like to call my role as cyber-coolie and not a software
engineer.
</p>
<p>
I totally agree with you when you say that this is no engineering.
Perhaps that is why my employer realised this and removed "Technologies"
from its name. :P
</p>
<p>
Onsite travel is now no longer a lucrative opportunity. Too many onsite
engineers work as production support guys. That is horrible! But given
that you get some decent money, people don't complain.
</p>
<p>
These companies say that the engineering colleges are not training
students to be skilled enough to be at par with the industry standards.
I would like to ask them, "Do these companies match the skills of the
students?"
</p>
<p>
I say to my juniors, "If you think you did something or learnt
something in the four years of engineering, dont join these companies." :)
</p>

I completely agree with you, Susam and Prunthaban. Even I lived in that
shell of IT services companies for a couple of years. Then I moved to a
startup.
</p>
<p>
Now when attending interviews, my toughest task is covering up my work
in the first company.
</p>
<p>
@Ajit Sahoo, Startup doesn't mean new company. Susam has given some
excellent examples of startups. Companies like Flipkart, Zoho, and
Aryaka are a few more examples I would like to add.

You know this is exactly the idealistic post that wants to make you feel
I am the rockstar because I did not join any of these companies. I
disagree with you.
</p>
<p>
I don't work in these organisations, but let me tell you, this whole
startup culture we are seeing just because the US is exploding is farcical
in my opinion. Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Palantir, etc. are exceptions
and not the norm. You know why people work there? Because they did their
engineering right in college. So any engineer who got his education
right will always find ways to solve problems. It is very easy to
criticise the processes and methodologies of these organisations, but
only true engineers can improve them. Most of the startups preach about
work culture, freedom, etc. Very few startups in India actually try or
think computationally. Most of these startups are web-based products and
sure as hell don't apply your graph algorithms or even basic algorithms.
</p>
<p>
I am not saying these organisations are the best thing to happen to our
country. Infact I think they might be a reason why one day we actually
have recession and people go jobless. My point is that if you get here,
try to be your man/woman. Work hard and learn as much as you can. We
still don't have startups which are actually using computer science.
There's more direction towards solving a problem which could make money
for you. You can easily find out about these startups by looking at
their hiring page. How many will appreciate your knowledge of Lisp or
assembly programming or that someone has read CLRS or TAOCP. All they
look for is a very good PHP developer to build stuff for them. If you
want to learn, get your education right. The rest will follow.

examples.

Ajit and Amey,
</p>
<p>
I have worked in one crappy company mentioned in the title of this blog
post. Then I switched to a startup. I agree that all startups
don't have good engineers. But many of them have. So I still disagree
that somebody should join Infosys, TCS, or Wipro and try to be his own
man/woman. The culture, stupid processes, tech leads of these
companies force you to develop software projects in bad ways.
</p>
<p>
It is always better to join startups if you don't get a call from Google,
Microsoft, etc. I don't agree that if your education is right, then the
rest will follow. Correct information is necessary or inexperienced
engineers will fall for overhyped brand names like Infosys, TCS, and
Wipro in spite of good education like I fell for the hype. This blog
post does very nice job of providing correct information.
</p>
<p>
After one year, I switched to startup. Now I am doing better work and I
am happy.

Amey,
</p>
<p>
You are not well informed. Each startup suggestion posted by Susam are
very respectable companies. They are also popular for keeping their
employees happy. If you think SlideShare.net only hires good PHP
developers I have only one thing to say. Please update your knowledge
about these companies before posting incorrect information.
SlideShare.net does a good variety of work. They have a good variety of
openings too. New engineers from colleges who join there start working
on creating Ruby or Python API in the beginning. Eventually they get to
work on distributed systems, map-reduce, search engines, analytics,
recommendation systems, etc. within one or two years. All of these
require good core computer science knowledge, algorithms, and also graph
theory.
</p>
<p>
So please refrain from posting incorrect comments without doing proper
research.

All,
</p>
<p>
Read all of the comments to the post and found them informative. But for
me, being just a student, these comments confused me more. Having
attended a pre-placement presentation of one of these companies in the morning
itself, I was, before reading this, sure of what my dream job was.
But now this blog post has definitely budged my perceptions. Regarding
startups, what do they look for in an engineering student? Does the graduation
institute matter? I must mention I am not from a very known college.
What I couldn't understand from the blog post is where to apply as a
fresh engineering graduate? What are the pre-requisites and whether to
pursue further studies? Thanks!

Abhay,

<p>
There is no general answer. Different startups have different
requirements. The companies have careers/jobs pages in their websites.
They should give you some ideas. No need to be from a very known college
for startups. They can't afford to keep engineers who can't do work. So
they hire with care. So just be good with your concepts.

I don't know if this has been brought up yet, but the blog post
seems to say that you don't find challenging problems in these big
IT companies, and hence the work you do there is not really
"engineering".
</p>
<p>
What is not appreciated is that these companies are <em>huge</em> and
somewhere some team certainly is working on challenging projects. They
even have dedicated research groups. However, you must proactively look
for them, and persistently try to join them. Just as they have "real"
problems, they need "real" engineers to solve them, and requests will
eventually be granted if they see that you are really good.
</p>
<p>
10 years ago, a friend was very interested in aeronautics, and he
actually found a related project in Infosys. Aeronautics, of all things!
</p>
<p>
It's just the nature of IT outsourcing that 95% of the work is
non-challenging CRUD work but then 95% of employees don't want
challenging work anyways. Be in the other 5%.

Loved your method to analyze the a company. The interviews. So clean a

IMHO, engineering is not always about doing low-level coding. It is also
about designing highly scalable systems, algorithms, applications, and
building them. :-)

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>
That's only true for problems that <em>can</em> be solved without
engineering. A large fraction of IT outsourcing projects are enterprise
applications, used only by hundreds or thousands of people at most. They
don't face, for instance, the scalability problems that require good
engineering, and hence simple solutions and brute force is sufficient
for most of these.
</p>
<p>
However, there certainly are projects with hard problems where only
proper engineering can get the work done. Or sometimes, otherwise dull
projects throw up a small but really hard problem. When I was there 10
years ago, I was aware of people in each of these companies solving
problems that required thoughtful engineering. Unsurprisingly, they were
also seen as the most valuable employees, the "go-to" people
whenever hard problems come up.
</p>
<p>
Granted that these were rare cases. But I think it will get better with
the US companies beginning to outsource their R&amp;D to India in
addition to the dull IT stuff.

After reading all these comments I just want to say that everyone has
their own view to see things. But yes, thank you very much for the
suggestions. I've heard a lot about these firms. My seniors who have
worked with these firms warned me earlier not to join them. I know many
people who left these companies.
</p>
<p>
besides this one more thing I would like to say that if you are about to
graduate and you have got a job in Infosys, TCS, or Wipro, it really
matters very much because of the big name associated with them. Many of
us want to know which type of environment, professionalism, people, and
opportunities are there. Some people say these are good. Some say they
aen't. I've not joined any of these yet. But I'll think about it when
the time comes. I don't want to waste my time by taking a wrong
decision. Thank you for writing this blog post.

<p>
I suggest looking for other job offers instead of joining Infosys, TCS,
or Wipro. Upload your resume to job portals. You may get calls from
startups. No offence meant but unless you want to end up like Sambeet Sahoo
working with ETL tools in these companies till you grow old, Infosys,
TCS, and Wipro are not worth joining.
</p>
<p>
Infosys, TCS, and Wipro are big names but not necessarily in a positive
way. You shall realize it later when you try to apply to big sofware
companies or startups that do good engineering work. Listen to your
seniors who have warned you about these companies. They are right.

<p>
First of all, nice blog post. Very informative to students like me who
are almost ready to step out of college. After reading this post, I must
admit that I am in a big state of confusion on what to do and what not
to. Unfortunately, I have been placed in one of these IT Companies in
college. Fortunately, I haven't joined them yet. My engineering course
is still going on and I am expecting my joining date to be at least 3
months away from now.
</p>
<p>
I have a good academic record throughout my career and an excellent
extracurricular track record.
</p>
<p>
You said in your blog post:
</p>
<blockquote>
Remember the technical problems they discuss in the interview. Think
about them later.
</blockquote>
<p>
This is now bothering me because this happened to me during the
interview, exactly as you described in your post. They did not
ask me any good technical problems at all in the technical interviews.
They only asked a few basic questions about the syntax of
<code>case</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>while</code>, etc. I still
think they just recruited me because of my high academic scores.
</p>
<p>
I come from a not so good college where one of these companies is
projected as the ultimate company that one can get into during campus
placements. I am not blaming my institution for it as it is situated in
a semi-urban place where this is the best that they could get for us.
</p>
<p>
I received a lot of input about this from my seniors. They have
mixed opinions about these IT services companies. Some of them say that
these companies are good but the majority of them have the same opinion
as yours.
</p>
<p>
My question is: If I choose to not join it and look out for other jobs
from startups or other companies, where do you think real engineering is
being done? Where can I really learn? How do i get into such companies?
</p>
<p>
I may not be the best technically skilled guy that they are looking for.
I must admit that I am poor in DFAs, graphs, and algorithms. But given a
chance and time, I can learn these topics and deliver what is expected
from me. I am really passionate about technology and 100% committed in
whatever i do. I presume that these startups really look for guys who
have done some extraordinary stuff like hacking, patents, and others.
But right now I'm building a cloud application as a part of my final
year project.
</p>
<p>
How can I get in touch with these startups and real engineering
companies? What do they look for? What are my options?

many tales of horror from my friends who have. Having worked in two good
startups (in fact, still at the second one), I concur that a lot of good
engineering happens in these small companies which the mainstream media
is not familiar with.
</p>
<p>
There are a lot of good startups coming up in various parts of India. I
urge all engineers to consider them if they genuinely want to engineer
great stuff.

Having worked for both: an MNC and a startup (in that order), I cannot
resist commenting on this.
</p>
<p>
I agree with all the points of yours. MNCs in India hire engineers and
convert them to software-tailors. I was lucky enough to realise this
within 5 months and switched jobs.
</p>
<p>
All that these so called hotshots worry about is billing and bench
strength. During my short stay in one of these, there was a point where
I was doing work which a high school student could do even though I am a
postgraduate in computer science.
</p>
<p>
From my experience (both during and after the MNC job), I believe that
people join them for job security (it takes months before someone
realises that you are not working good enough and should be fired) and
a chance to earn more money from onsite travel.
</p>
<p>
Overall, this post is very nice advice for fresh engineering graduates.
I appreciate it.

Hi Susam,
</p>
<p>
I totally agree with you. I have worked for one of these organizations
and know how it feel. If you are a hacker, then working at these
organizations will kill your soul.

Hi Susam,
</p>
<p>
I agree with you on some points. But I would like to make a few points.
You said that these organizations teach a new programming language in 3
days! They hav chosen engineers from engineering colleges, so the
students which they hav recruited are expected to have sufficient
knowledge of the engineering syllabus! These companies are not there to
provide these students a degree. They just want to provide them with
a basic knowledge of what they have already learnt in their engineering!
</p>
<p>
For the rest of the post, hats off to you! What a nice post!

Hi Susam,
</p>
<p>
Excellent blog post! I think the best thing a student can do after
graduating is either join a good startup or create their own startup.
They will learn more in 2 years than they would have in any other
company. I feel that at that age (most) people do not have many
responsibilities and they also have tons of energy to work 16 hour days.
</p>
<p>
In fact I think that learning with open courseware and creating your
startup simultaneously is better than doing a degree in CS or IT. But
that is a different story. :-)
</p>
<p>
What you say about training sessions in these companies is spot on. I
have conducted many corporate training sessions and my general
observation is that most participants treat it as relaxation time.
Basically it is time to spend away from real work where they will learn
a bit and generally spend time on chat and email.
</p>
<p>
Great blog, by the way. Your blog is going in my blog reader. :-)

kickbacks?

Agree on all your points.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Training is given by companies not to train people, but to bond
      them. In India, it's illegal for companies to bond employees
      (bonded labors or slavery was abolished centuries ago), so they
      train saying training costs 2,00,000 INR and you should pay it
      back if you leave within two years.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Engineering: What you study in India in "engineering" colleges is
      not engineering. After working for three years, I did my
      postgraduate education in Singapore. Education in Singapore
      focusses only on your ability to understand concepts. Exams have
      just 2 to 3 questions in total and you have 3 hours of time to
      answer them. You have to think and write the answer in the exam
      hall. They make you think.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is an example question from our exam in Singapore: "Scenario
      1: An employee working with you on a project suddenly expresses
      his intention to quit. With your knowledge of human resource
      management, how will you convince him to stay with you." An
      equivalent question from an Indian university would look like
      this: "Briefly explain the ten techniques of employee retention.
      (10 marks)"
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      I wrote about our education standard 4 years ago:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="http://thoughts.mugunthkumar.com/quality-of-education-in-india/">http://thoughts.mugunthkumar.com/quality-of-education-in-india/</a>

        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Culture: Are you aware that some project managers expect money or
      high value gadgets in return for sending their subordinates
      onsite? Even more ugly press-unfriendly things happen with female
      employees.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      This is the exact reason why I am in a foreign land. Not everyone
      loves to be in a foreign country. In fact, most don't. But we
      don't have a choice.

I do not work in any of these organisations but I feel one should
understand the difference between service industry and product industry.
Both are different ball games and both the industries cannot survive
without each other. SAP, for example, develops its products but various
organisations implement it according to the need of the clients. This is
very business specific and requires analytical and logical decisions
along with a lot of engineering concepts.
</p>
<p>
My question to Susam: What would you call an employee working in a steel
plant's floor where most of the work is automated and a so called
engineer just monitors the process? He still is called an engineer
inspite of being involved in none of the engineering activities.
</p>
<p>
By the way, the Oxford dictionary meaning of engineering might help:
"The application of scientific and mathematical principles to practical
ends such as the design, manufacture, and operation of efficient and
economical structures, machines, processes, and systems."
</p>
<p>
So what you are talking about is just a difference between a good
engineer and a bad engineer.

Rahul,
</p>
<p>
You asked me:
</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>
I am not sure how this is related to my blog post. I am talking about
software engineering only in this blog post. Perhaps this question is a
rhetorical one. In case it isn't, here is what I have got to say.
</p>
<p>
If an engineering graduate cannot use his engineering knowledge to
solve a problem where there are well known engineering concepts and
techniques known to solve the problem, such a person probably should not
be called or hired as an engineer.
</p>
<p>
Since such people are plenty in Infosys, TCS, and Wipro, I believe a
young engineer would learn less in these companies than they would by
joining startups and companies with a strong engineering culture such as
Adobe, Microsoft, etc.

Hi,
</p>
<p>
You just read my mind completely. I am actually one of those kind of
people who joined Infosys without any clue and then
after 1.7 years, a few days ago, I sent my resignation.
</p>
<p>
To add to the usual misery, they exploit employees! Managers order us to
come on weekends and stay late nights as if they are commanders! I have
never listened to them, so my name is always on the hit list. :)
</p>
<p>
Many people who are so dedicated and committed are wasting their time
14-15 hours in office for the low salaries these people pay! With the
same dedication, they can reach heights if they were in some other
better company. But they are afraid. They want security, the biggest
disease in India right now!

<p>
A really interesting blog post indeed. Here are a few points I would
like to put forward. Also please bear in mind, I in no way endorse any
of the firms.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Software industry by its own nature is really young. The
      compliance regulations and processes are not so filtered, at least
      as of now, to be called engineering. Most of the engineers in
      India are lured by the instant gratification, i.e., good salaries,
      onsite travel, etc., rather than learning. The services sector
      provides a good platform to launch one's career. I am talking
      purely from an average engineer's point of view. Even you might
      agree that very few of us treat engineering subjects seriously.
      That is why to the unsure and clueless, I think these companies
      provide a platform to launch a career.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Concerning the non-IT/computer science background people, from my
      personal experience, it provides a great learning experience, at
      least the training part. I was computer illiterate as far as
      programming is concerned. Whatever I learnt at Infosys was a huge
      help while finding on campus jobs during my masters program while
      writing programs to solve engineering problems during my masters
      (most of which was C++). I am not trying to blow my own trumpet
      but on the basis of the skills learnt during the training (though
      it used to be only 3-5 days per language), I managed to learn new
      stuff, keep myself updated and later apply the same while taking
      part in competitions organized by software giants like Microsoft.
      It also depends on personal motivation, how you learn and later
      hone it to apply elsewhere.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Now coming to strictly IT/computer science people, even I agree if
      they want to make sense of their field as engineering, then they
      should not join these companies. Instead, join a small product
      company which designs simple websites but don't get dragged into
      the hell of the software service industry. If onsite travel is
      what motivates you, then go for higher studies instead if your
      financial conditions are stable and apply for jobs at product
      companies later.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      We are innocent at the age of 21-22, so let us not forget that we
      need to learn by experiencing things ourselves. From what I have
      learnt in life so far, even a household problem can become an
      engineering one. A true engineer I think is one who uses his/her
      reasoning to come to conclusions and design solutions which best
      fit the situation by optimizing resources.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
Oh and by the way, I joined Infosys because I was mesmerized by Narayana
Murthy. I know it was naive but it was worth at least trying.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I don't want to justify any reasons anyone has for joining these
firms. I am just saying its not possible to take the correct decisions
when you are fresh out of college. But yes, I would rather double-check
my motivation to join any company, not just these. That, I think, is
possible for everyone.
</p>
<p>
Your post made me think a lot, so thanks for writing this post.

Thanks, Susam, for an excellent piece of writing and the follow up
discussion.
</p>
<p>
Society gets what society deserve. Problem does not lie in TCS, Infosys,
etc. They are service providers. Nothing to do with engineering. They
built a system where a donkey can win the race and bring laurel to his
CV, status, family, etc.
</p>
<p>
You are right in saying that it is not good to be in Infosys, TCS, or
Wipro if you want to explore engineering. It is good if you want name,
fame, money, etc.
</p>
<p>
Susam, you lose one point though. Your post confuses a fresh engineering
graduate about what they should do. It is not their fault. It is the
fault of the system, the seniors, and the elders.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Training: Even big brands provide it, smalls one don't. It is the
      fault of trainee or trainer or facilitator if the outcome is
      negligible.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Engineering: Who cares at all! Taking degree matters and
      subsequently job and money. Education level is at its nadir.
      People can't make Mona Lisa. They just scan or copy-paste.
      Attitude of society towards scientific stdudies has to be blamed
      for this as they don't encourage students to take
      scientific/engineering challenges.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Engineers: Organisational stucture and policies of these three
      companies can turn so called engineers into great IT brains of
      India. Ha ha.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Culture: They become earner after joining any organisation. They
      got freedom to do anything up to any level. Level of intensity may
      differ but the situation is grave.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Onsite: Knowledge and skill does not determine who will travel
      onsite. Only approach matters and internal politics.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
Hats off to Susam and other participants of this lively discussion.

There is a very interesting pattern in the long debate in the comments
here.
</p>
<p>
The people who disagree with this article are either still working in
one of these three companies or they have never worked in one of these
three companies.
</p>
<p>
Those who have worked in one of these three companies and then left it
to join a better company are the ones who agree with the article in
their comments.
</p>
<p>
There are two implications of this pattern. Those who disagree with this
article have seen only one side of the software industry. Those who
agree with this article have seen both sides of the software industry.

I have to disagree with your tone of trying to guide all. :) Let us
say that your brand of engineering is trying to answer core problems. We
require both the core and the periphery problems answered. Exactly why
we have fewer of the likes of Google and more of Infosys. Although I
have my personal preferences that slant with your views,
philosophically, your answer is not exactly correct.

I too have a similar story. I worked in Infosys for 2 years, got caught
in the bureaucracy, and then the only option to get out of the vicious
circle was to quit. I left Infosys to join a startup. I promised myself
that I would never work for Infosys or a similar company again.

You have missed the point of this blog post. Let me clarify it once
again. This blog post is not about whether we require both engineering
and non-engineering problems or why we have fewer companies like Google
and more like Infosys.
</p>
<p>
This blog post is about which company young engineers should join so
that he can make better use of their time at work and learn more
engineering.

<p>
The commenters who said that they have met some good engineers in these
companies, I have a question for them. This blog post says that the
number of engineers is very less in these companies. What do you think
is wrong here? There are some good engineers but there are many bad
engineers. So it is possible that you had colleagues who were well
respected but the majority of colleagues in Infosys, TCS, and Wipro are
not like that.
</p>
<p>
I worked in one of these companies and I will tell you what kind of
things happen in these companies.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      People insult each other in bulletin board. I am not kidding. This
      is true.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Guys leave useless and flirtatious comments on blogs of girls in
      the internal blogs.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      You have to compulsorily stay 9.5 hours in office every day even
      if you have no work.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      In many projects there is no system of code review. How will
      engineers learn from their mistakes without code review?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      File check-in is done not using standard client side tools but
      some crappy software created by the internal IT team. The crappy
      software is an interface between CVS and desktop. You have to reserve
      names for new files you have created one by one, then upload them
      one by one, upload each modified file one by one via a web-based
      interface. It takes roughly 3 hours to check in just 10 files.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
I agree with the author that these companies have one of the worst
cultures.
</p>
<p>
I started my career here and after that I worked in 3 more different
companies. All the three were better than these companies. At least I
can check in code properly where I am now. At least I can disagree with
other people in company bulletin board without fearing that someone will
abuse me or insult me. Infosys, TCS, or Wipro is an absolutely bad place
to start your career if your aim is to learn good programming, learn
good work culture, and gain good knowledge from good colleagues.

Kalyan Suri, Narayan Babu, etc.
</p>
<p>
I have one simple question to you people who are commenting that fresh
engineering graduates should join Infosys, TCS, or Wipro. Why? You guys
are not giving any good reason that is important to us. You guys are
simply giving only philosophy like someone can join Infosys and similar
companies to change the system, improve its culture and engineering
practices, service work is also important with product work, etc.
</p>
<p>
Fresh engineering graduates like us are not interested in philosophy. We
want to use our knowledge, do good work, and earn money.
</p>
<p>
Why should they join a company to change the system and improve the
culture of the company? Are they social reformers? Are they the managers
of these companies? Should they rebel against the CEOs and the HRs of
these companies to create a new culture?
</p>
<p>
I am just not able to understand why you guys are asking that someone
should join these companies and work with people who don't know how to
do proper engineering and force you to follow software practices?
</p>
<p>
In short you guys tell me why any fresh graduate should join a company
to do all these philosophical and cultural improvements instead of
trying to join a company where they can do proper engineering work,
learn good coding and engineering practices from senior engineers, and
also earn more money.

Quite impressed by your article. What you have written is the reality.
That is what is happening in these so called IT firms. A bulk of fresh
talent is being wasted in the air-conditioned offices of these firms.
Nowadays, good stuff is available on the Internet and social networking
websites about the work in these IT firms which helps software job
aspirants to take right decisions for their future. I have the same
suggestion to all the job aspirants: Dont run in the rat race. Just
choose the job that is in accordance with your skill, so that you can
get an opportunity to explore and enhance it.

Very nice post. I second the thought that IT companies are wasting loads
of talent by hiring then and utilizing them as mere resources. But the
flip side to this is that the young talented IT folks should also
realize this. They have to take control of their careers. If they are
focused enough, IT companies should just be a part of the journey, not
the destination.

launched a community website for IT professionals and shall refer this

There is a huge misconception about the software industry in India,
especially among Indians. That misconception is that the software
companies like the ones you mentioned above employ smart people and that
their main business proposition is that they make the Indian "talent"
pool available to clients overseas. The fact is, these companies help
fill up the clerical jobs that are just too expensive to do at the
client's end.
</p>
<p>
The British designed our education system to produce clerks. We are
continuing their good work and companies like the ones above are filling
their coffers by making use of this pool of clerks. They do a great job
of glorifying the work which they give to their employees, by giving
them glass buildings to sit in and providing them with a conducive
environment to meet their future spouse, so that it creates a better
lock-in.

Nice post. Your post is depicting the reality. Unfortunately, the people
working in these organizations run away from the truth. It reminds me of
the classic case of ostrich which tries to hide its face from the
hunter. Let me introduce myself. I have an experience of 5 years in the
IT industry. I have worked in Infosys. Your descriptio of these
companies is absolutely right.
</p>
<p>
In my first organization (not Infosys), I started facing
discrimination from my manager who was an electrical engineer. She was
totally useless. She had never heard of Norton's theorem. I quit that
organization and landed in Infosys.
</p>
<p>
Infosys was a nightmare for me. Half of the people there could not
construct proper sentences in email communication. None of them did any
engineering. Calling these people engineers is nothing but disrespect to
the word "engineer". These people didn't even know the difference
between HTML and XML. The middle managers are too bossy and too
arrogant. They turn the lives of employees into a nightmare.

<p>
Continuing from my previous comment.
</p>
<p>
There are some trolls commenting here and defending these companies. I
want to tell them to please stop calling themselves engineers. The title
which is appropriate for such people is "softicians", just like
"technicians".
</p>
<p>
The type of emotive responses these commenters are posting come from
people who know the reality but are hiding away from the facts. This
blog post is truly accurate. You will not find any engineering happening
in these organizations. If someone has to be an engineer, he would use
all the formal methods of engineering. In computer science, it includes
modelling, finite automata, performance measurement, etc. Such things do
not happen in these organizations.
</p>
<p>
If you are interested in engineering, better to go to some organization
where engineering actually happens.

Personal experience: Did a contract in Germany and part of the solution
involved working with Infosys guys. They were "cheap" and a dime a
dozen.
</p>
<p>
Infosys focuses on quantity rather than quality. A great deal of the
time they'll ship over many developers to do 1 developer's job. At the
same time they'll ship over an organizer who is responsible for
coordinating with the Infosys guys - like an onsite PM, except without
any power.
</p>
<p>
The guys we dealt with were all terrible communicators, just there for
the money, and not very skilled. They constantly over engineered
solutions, and gave a lot of "It's not possible" answers.
</p>
<p>
The actual product we worked with was Remedy, and I have to say it was a
joke. Extremely cumbersome, most likely built by the same sort of
monkeys we had to deal with.

All in all, it's not an experience I want to repeat.

Susam,
</p>
<p>
I understand where you are coming from. We need to realise that these IT
companies are businesses whose stock is people (like toothpaste is stock
for Hindustan Lever). You have stock in various levels of finish. Some
might be work in progress (in training). Some might be ready-to-sell.
And the business will always take good care of the stock (making sure
the toothpaste stays at the right temperature for example), so they can
sell the stock (market the skillset).
</p>
<p>
Big IT firms treat its employees like cattle and no one realises it
because the cattle is well fed and the butchering (of talent and free
thinking) happens over a period of 20-30 years.

Hi Susam,
</p>
<p>
I wwent through your article and couldn't agree more on most counts.
When I completed my studies and 90% of my batchmates were placed in
swanky air-conditioned offices with pretty girls around in good cities, I always
wondered what went wrong with me. But soon, in 5 years of time, I realised
what most of these software professionals do: cribbing, cribbing, and
cribbing, all the time!
</p>
<p>
No offense meant to anyone but trust me when I say that I started my
career in a very hard way. Today, having woked in Volvo and being in
Hyundai, I can tell you that most of the software professionals start
living in such a small shell that they get very easily worked up by real
life obstacles. I mean their lives becomes so small: bitcing about
collegues, gossips, pretty girls and onsite travel. Is this what we were
meant to be while we were students?
</p>
<p>
As for the engineering part, Susam, even for me who is in a full fledged
proper technology company I must say it is challenging to do what you
really want because you always have to balance between what you want and
the money you need to survive and how you get it. But on the whole, a
good observation.

It completely depends on the personal interest of the individual. There
are a lot of open source communities to showcase engineering talent. But
for making money, your need to work somewhere initially in companies
like TCS. I believe talent without money is useless. There are many
people who started their career in TCS and went to Google by showcasing
there talent in open source communities.

@Susam, Absolutely correct. People who disagree belong to one of these
categories:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Managers in Infosys, TCS, Wipro, etc.</li>
  <li>Those planning to write GRE/GMAT/CAT.</li>
  <li>People who need to get their heads examined.</li>
</ol>
<p>
There is no fourth category.
</p>
<p>
For people who really want to do  good work and want to find great ppl
to work with, I am presenting a list of companies in a categorized
manner below. I hope it helps CS/IT graduates. This list is based on my
interactions with friends and colleagues regarding the places where they
work. In the list below, product based startups fall between levels A+
and B. Here is the list:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Level A+: Google, IBMRL, HP Research, Zynga, and RSA. These are the
      best places to be in. This is where the most talented engineers
      work.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Level A: Intuit, Microsoft, Yahoo, Amazon, and Flipkart. Sometimes
      the work is really of A+ level but sometimes it is not. I know many
      will disagree but some of the folks from these companies will agree.
      This is where the cream of the talent is.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Level B: Thoughtworks and Robosoft. These are difficult to get
      into but not as difficult as those in levels A+ and A. They are
      not always engineering focussed.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Level C: Aditi, Persistent, and any outsourced product development
      companies.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Level D: Dell, Verizon, Qwest, Bank of America, and
      any US company which does not sell software but sells phone lines,
      credit cards, etc. The auality of work is same as Infosys, TCS,
      and Wipro but there is some chance that you might meet someone
      intelligent here. Pay is slightly better than Infosys, TCS, and
      Wipro. This should be the second last resort.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Level E: Infosys, TCS, Wipro, Cognizant, HCL, IGATE, Patni, HP,
      Sonata, Covansys, Accenture, and IBM. These are the worst. You can
      send your mother-in-law to work here.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
In all of these companies, Patni is probably the worst.

Hi,
</p>
<p>
I work for Accenture and while the culture and software practices seem
to be better, overall we don't work on any real computer science
problems. If you didn't have an algorithm or puzzle round in your
selection process, be assured you aren't going to face any computer
science problem there.
</p>
<p>
I knew what piece of cake I was getting for what price. I go to office,
have 9 easy hours and comeback with a salary that will support me till
the time I jump into the real race! That being said, I know, I am not
an engineer because I don't do anything new. But I am a smart graduate
who earns 30,000 INR per month without deserving it!

I agree with your post. If you really want to make your career path
strong, then small companies are very good for freshers. The reason
behind it is that those companies provide complete exposure to all the
employees. You are included in all the phases of software construction,
so your knowledge and skills increase. Obviously, then you can switch to
any MNCs which have their own advantages like higher salaries.

My pedantic contribution.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Yes, I can learn a useful amount of a typical programming language
      in three days. That doesn't mean Haskell, but it does (and did)
      mean Pascal, Modula 2, Ada, C, C++, Java and C# among others.
      Usually, that mostly means how to spell the same old concepts,
      with very few new semantic ideas. The new semantic ideas can often
      be considered "special purpose", and can best be learned later, as
      needed to do the job. Learning the first three days worth in a
      training course (or from videos) is useful because it's just so
      damn boring - paying attention throughout the whole thing is
      impossible, so you need the training to carry on while you're 90%
      asleep or else you never finish. 10% awake is more than enough.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Regular expressions can test for balanced parentheses. They can even
      test for any depth of balanced parentheses, so long as you know the
      finite maximum depth you need to test for when you construct the regex.
      I don't claim it's practical (context-free grammars and push-down
      automata exist for a reason, even though most nesting isn't that deep in
      the real world), but this isn't a sane argument, it's pedantry. ;-)
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
</p>
<!-- date: 2011-12-06 06:11:31 +0000 -->

Good points Steve but remember that you need to be fairly interested in
programming and technology to pick up a new language in 3 days of
training. Most programmers I meet in the software industry aren't so
interested. Those who are and have the ability to pick up a new language
in 3 days don't work for Indian IT outsourcing firms. :-) So the first
point of the author is still valid. Those who can pick up a new language
in 3 days should stay away from these companies.
</p>
<p>
If you really want to be pedantic, you shouldn't assume that an
upper-bound to the depth of nested parentheses is known. Perl-derived
regular expressions which support a lot of fancy features including
recursive patterns can solve the problem for an arbitrary depth of
nested parentheses but they are not true regular expressions. They are
extensions to formal regular expressions. Moreover, POSIX BREs are
incapable of handling recursive patterns and they cannot test for
balanced parentheses.

As a US citizen with a "name brand" PhD in Engineering, I can assure you
that things are much the same stateside. US corporations like LM, GD,

them to do menial clerical jobs.

Yeah, pushdown automata should be used to detect balanced set of
parentheses, not regular expressions because they are finite automata.

I totally agree with the author of this post. I have a master's degree
in computer science from the University Of Calcutta. I had a university
rank in both of my bachelor's degree studies and master's degree
studies. I am working in one of these three companies. I have done three
months of training in the company. I have not seen a single line of code
so far. I have done my training well and I got to learn a lot but what I
am doing now and will continue to do for the next two months is
translating some documents from one language to another. I am also
supposed to do some support work (no software developement at all) and
although I have no work to do, I have to sit in front of my machine for
9 hours a day. This is an unproductive use of a person who has
researched on "Distributed file system and parallel computing" in her
final semester.
</p>
<p>
My seniors who are not all from CS/IT background, felt that it is very
easy to learn any pogramming language in 3 days. I guess what they meant
by "learning" is learning only the syntax of the language.
</p>
<p>
I am very upset as I can't utilise my knowledge and can't learn anything
except some syntax. I want to leave this job and want to sudy hard for
getting into research. Maybe I have to stay unemployed for a long
period. My family and I can afford it now but it's not possible for
every individual. I have to turn myself away from all the luxury I've
been used to for the past six months. But I want to do something which
is relevant to what I've studied and learnt. Being creative at my heart,
I can't do this support job anymore.
</p>
<p>
My advice to all the fresh engineering graduates who want to do
something in engineering and doesn't need money immediately is to wait
and think before you join one of these companies.

I was jobless when my friends were getting selected in these companies.
In those days, they used to advice me to at least attempt the selection
process of these donkey pulling companies. But now that I work for a
reputed engineering company, they do not have anything to say to me.

My opinion on the points you have made in this post:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Training: Organizations have to show evidence of training to their
      clients to get projects. It has nothing to do with providing knowledge to
      engineers. You can't feed software engineering into any individual
      in 3 months which normally takes 4 years to imbibe.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Engineering: It depends on luck whether you get a good project
      which truly tests your engineering skills or not.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Engineers: It's not the company's fault that they do not have many
      engineers. It is the institutions in which they studied that
      couldn't produce engineers. Not everyone has the capability to
      become an engineer. If the institutions aren't right, even the
      brightest could fail. Good institutions can make the dullest
      shine.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Culture: It depends on your circle of people who you work with.
      You will always find the culture about which you complain. Even
      small companies try to get the most out of you, make you work
      overnight, weekdays, ask you to keep your mobiles off, do not let
      you access internet, etc. Small companies do not have the best
      culture but they are not the worst.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Onsite: I agree with what you have said about this.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
I worked with Infosys 3 years ago. I have also worked at client side
with Cisco and Microsoft. I currently run my own small software company
in my hometown. After working in all these companies, I came to the same
conclusion as yours for the question, "Infosys, TCS, or Wipro?" My
answer too is, "None."
</p>
<p>
For guys and girls who read Susam's post and then took the pain to
read this comment, do not worry if you are not able to get into one of
these MNCs or if you do not get what you deserve, be it in terms of
project or salary. There are many small software companies out there
which apply engineering. Go for it. Don't worry about the pay.
Think what would happen to you if you are put into some bullshit
maintenance project for a year doing some mere repetitive stuff. Your
mind would accumulate rust. When the project is over or you switch
companies, you will no longer able to perform the way you could have
when you were a fresher. In case you feel stuck in a project, take a
bold decision and inform your manager to switch to another. Yes, you can
shout and you can pick the project you want.

<p>
It is true that the culture depends on the circle of people who we work
with but it is not true that we will always find such bad culture
elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
I started my career in Infosys and truly the culture was abysmal. I did
see employees attacking each other personally with profane language in
the internal corporate forums. After I left Infosys, I have worked for
many other product companies. I have not found such bad culture ever
again in any other company.

I blame these companies for creating standardized tests as a barrier to
entry, and for becoming reliant on these tests to sort potential
employees. Worse, I was floored when I came across the concept of
"placement papers" which appear to be prevalent in India. Unbelievable!
</p>
<p>
If a company hands you a standardized test in your field of study, it
says a lot about that company. (Unable to judge talent. Blind to the
fact that their tests are being gamed.) It says a lot about their
confidence in your education. (Is the diploma worth something, or does
it just say that you've gone through the motions?) And if a job seeker
goes along with it, it says a lot about them, too. (You really want a
job and can't do better. You went to a school that a company doesn't
trust, and you're willing to work for a company that is demonstrating to
you that it is poor with cultivating talent.)

I have worked for a decade in TCS and longer in the industry overall. I
would like to post a more inclusive response to this issue.
</p>
<p>
The fact that 300,000 people are working in a functioning organization
is indeed commendable. They win projects worth hundreds of millions of
dollars, add value to customers, and create skilled workers in the
industry. Let's give them the due credit as well.
<p>
<p>
Having said that, these companies are definetely not for the best
brains. The poor salaries they offer attract poor talent. For example,
Google offered 197,000 dollars to IIT Kharagpur students during campus
placement. That is close to 1 crore rupees. TCS also went to the same
campus and offered only 3 lakh rupees of salary. :)
</p>
<p>
But some exceptionally smart engineers do end up joining these low
paying companies and hate these organizations, their culture, work
practices, and opportunities for development. This is a hard reality of
the Indian IT services companies.
</p>
<p>
I agree with most of the points that the blogger has made in this post.
Forget about engineering, they go and recruit B.Com./B.Sc./Dilpoma
degree holders and employ them as software engineers. The bottom line is
if you are a serious engineer, look for another job. Don't get stuck
doing data entry in the Indian IT services companies.
</p>
<p>
The most demeaning part about working in these companies is indeed the
culture and the senior employees who never deserved to reach their
positions and draw 25 to 30 lakh rupees of salary. They are producing
demeaning human values in these companies. They are not involved in any
productive work. I am saying this from my first hand experience.
</p>
<p>
An open message to any CEO who is reading these comments. It is easy to
replace a good worker but it is very difficult to go back to a good
culture after it is spoilt. Right now the rotting culture of these
companies is going to an abyss with no possibility of return.

I joined TCS thinking it to be a great Tata company and continued there
for a decade. The company has detiorated to rock bottom. Let me be
absolutely candid here. It is a place for below average people, who are
weak technically, lack ethics, can easily compromise with their values,
and fear proper competitive firms. As a result, after few years you find
yourself in the middle of highly manipulative and insecure people who
are not just incompetent but morally degraded as well.
</p>
<p>
My advice to all young engineers is to work hard, target a smaller (even
a startup) company and do something good for their future. There is
nothing left in the "Tata" name of "Tata Consultancy Services". TCS is
now good for BPO/BPS executives, not for engineers who want to solve
engineering problems, create solutions, and build something good for
their customers, their country, or even themselves.

Well said! I'm glad there are people who think like me. It is six years
after you wrote this post. This looks more like a prophecy now. With all
the H1B visa curbs by Trump, we can see engineers switching to companies
that offer them more value. We hardly innovate anything in this country. We
need more contributions from engineers now more than ever. It's time for
Indian software engineers to innovate and contribute something
significantly.
