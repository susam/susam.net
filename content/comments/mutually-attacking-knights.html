  There is a simpler solution.  First place a \( 2 \times 3 \) or \( 3
  \times 2 \) rectangle, then choose a pair of corners in this
  rectangle to place the knights.  There are \( n - 1 \) choices for
  the column and \( n - 2 \) choices for the row of a \( 2 \times 3 \)
  rectangle, and the same number but with the axes flipped for a \( 3
  \times 2 \) rectangle.  In total, there are \( 2 \times 2 \times
  (n-1) \times (n - 2) = 4(n-1)(n-2) \) ways to place the knights.

  Hi James!  Did you read the section
  <a href="../mutually-attacking-knights.html#counting-placements-from-minimal-attack-sections">Counting Placements from Minimal Attack Sections</a>?
  The simpler solution you present is exactly the simple solution
  already discussed in that section.
