  In my maths circle, we used it frequently for quickly brainstorming
  problems and sharing it among each other often on stream as a
  lightweight solution.  Glad it is open source for future use for
  private instances.  Thank you for the service.

  It feels a bit sentimental to see it shutting down, but it was a
  great help for me to easily get help from friends when I was doing
  my bachelor degree in engineering.  But the conclusion for it
  shutting down is understandable.

  I'm sorry to hear that.  The independent web is gradually declining,
  becoming increasingly controlled by bit tech companies.  The
  original vision and spirit of the independent web are fading away
  due to many reasons, which is disheartening.  Thank you for all your
  hard work.

  Hello, I am a casual user of MathB.in.  I must have been using it
  for over 5 years, and it's been a very useful tool.  It's basically
  the place where I developed my ability to write in LaTeX.  So I
  appreciate you maintaining it up to now, and I understand your
  reasons for stopping.  Best wishes!

  It would be fair to publish a cast of the database so that content
  creators can republish their pastes somewhere else.
