  Hi!  Firstly, congratulations on your pages, they are really cool!
  I'm hoping to get my own space online at some point soon, and yours
  is an inspiration!
</p>
<p>
  I think I found a typo on your paredit-slurp-and-barf-mnemonics
  page.  When you explain barfing for the first time, you
  write <code>paredit-backward-slurp-sexp</code> when you meant
  <code>paredit-backward-barf-sexp</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Also, I think that I found a bug (or feature?) of Paredit.
  <code>paredit-delete-char</code> doesn't seem to play well with
  the <code>undo</code> command in Emacs.  Try typing <code>a
  "bcd"</code>, then moving the pointer to the point just before the
  first double quotes, then run
  <code>paredit-delete-char</code>, followed by <code>undo</code>.
  I'll report it in case it is useful.

  Thank you for reporting the typo.  I had indeed
  written <code>paredit-backward-slurp-sexp</code> when I
  meant <code>paredit-backward-barf-sexp</code>.  I have fixed it now.
</p>
<p>
  By the way, I could not reproduce any odd behaviour pertaining
  to <code>undo</code> after <code>paredit-delete-char</code>.  If I
  run <code>paredit-delete-char</code> while the point is placed just
  before the first double quotation mark, nothing happens since
  Paredit cannot delete it without making the double quotation marks
  imbalanced.  For me, an <code>undo</code> after that does undo the
  last edit made before <code>paredit-delete-char</code>.
