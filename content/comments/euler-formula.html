  Agreed, the full formula is much more intersting and deep: it shows
  there is a mapping between the reals and the circle group that
  preserves the structure (turns addition into multiplication).  This
  concept leads to the very general exponential map of a Lie algebra
  to a Lie group and Pontryagin duality, which is the essence of
  Fourier transform.

  I vividly remember my maths teacher impressing us upon what you
  stated above.  By far the best math teacher I had.  He didn't work
  out the proof on the board but made us work it out, took us on a
  journey, him as a guide, so to speak.

  In a way it's analogous to how Einstein's \( E = mc^2 \) is a
  special case of how the norm of the four-momentum is defined in
  special relativity, which is \( mc = \sqrt{(E/c)^2 - p^2 \}.  For
  the special case of a stationary object we have \( p = 0 \), so \( E
  = mc^2 \) follows automatically.  But the special case is somehow
  more memorable and more famous, and I believe something similar has
  happened with Euler's identity.

  Visual Complex Analysis is the text that introduced me to this
  concept.  The functions \( \cos \) and \( \sin \) suddenly look a
  lot like accessor functions for a two member object.

  It's a unification of geometry and algebra in 2 dimensions, but
  generalizations beyond that are scarce.  Effectively we're left with
  a solution where we can represent any space in dimensions modulo 2.
</p>
<p>
  While quaternions and some higher dimensional complex numbers exist,
  is there a unified formula expressing Euler's formula for arbitrary
  numbers of dimensions?  Is there one for an infinite dimension
  space?
