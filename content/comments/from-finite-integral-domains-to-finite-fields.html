  This was a great read!  The explanation of why every finite integral
  domain is a field was clear and insightful.  It's fascinating how
  the absence of zero divisors and the finiteness of the set combine
  to ensure that every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse.
  Thanks for breaking it down so well.
