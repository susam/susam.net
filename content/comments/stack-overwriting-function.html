  Good article.  This is how buffer overflow is exploited.  But I
  guess, kernel provides some random stack alignment to prevent this.

  I think you mean ASLR.  On Linux, this can be turned off by running
  <code>echo 0 &gt; /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space</code>.  On
  Windows, DEP can be turned off at <samp>Control Panel</samp> &rarr;
  <samp>System</samp> &rarr; <samp>Advanced</samp> &rarr;
  <samp>Performance</samp> &rarr; <samp>Settings</samp>, if I remember
  correctly.
