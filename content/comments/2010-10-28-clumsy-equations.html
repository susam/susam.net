  Just curious about this part,

<p>
  What exactly were you calculating?

  I was calculating the optimal parameters for bloom filters, a
  space-efficient probabilistic data structure.  At RSA, we develop
  software products for security operations centre (SOC) that parse,
  index, and query petabytes of security events.  We use bloom filters
  to speed up queries in the querying engine of these products while
  occupying less storage space than a traditional inverted index.
