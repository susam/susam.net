<p>
  The <code>float8_accum</code> is the aggregate state transition
  function which maintains an internal state which changes for every
  new <code>float8</code> input value.
</p>
<p>
  It requires a three-element array, not just two elements, because it
  accumulates the sum of squares as well as the sum and count of the
  inputs.  This is so that it can be used for some other aggregates
  besides <code>avg</code>.
