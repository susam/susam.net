  So it happened like 900 years ago and after the next one it will
  almost take 900 years for it to happen again.  And I am alive on one
  of this rare event.  Need to cut cake.  :)

  I love the term "middle endianness" and how clearly it highlights
  how nuts the American date notation is.

<p>
  FWIW, in my native language, most numbers from 100 and 1000 are
  pronounced middle endian, so I'm not complaining.

  Little endian notation is somewhat mixed endian itself, because it
  contains 3 numbers, each number by itself is big endian, but the 3
  numbers are arranged in little endian fashion amongst each other.

  Wow!  Pretty significant since the last one was 908 years ago.  Next
  one isn't for 101 years!

  Hahahajaha.  "Middle Endian"!  When will Americans just admit
  they're the only country that managed to screw up their date syntax.
  Just switch to ISO already so you can keep the month-day sequence,
  and no one can possibly mistake which number the year is.
